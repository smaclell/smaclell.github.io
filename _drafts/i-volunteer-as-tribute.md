For the next 4 months, I will be joining a different team dedicated to making
our software better and addressing customer issues. I am excited for the change
and optimistic about the problems I will be solving.

In the fall the [company][d2l] I work for started implementing a rotation
program where developers throughout various teams would work on client facing
issues. This is a fantastic way to learn about our product and make a real
impact. Every team sends one developer for a standard rotation of 4 months and
the first set of developers are now returning to their original teams. I did
not get to participate the first time around, but excitedly volunteered to be
next in line.

FOMO - Fear of Missing Out
===============================================================================

Although it is now my turn to go I have been having trouble wrestling with a
distinct feeling of missing out. An extreme case of
<abbr title="Fear of Missing Out">FOMO</abbr> developed that I needed to
reason through.

My current team does amazing things that continue to shift how our company
operates and is at the helm of a very important project. We have hit a few
personal milestones and continue to ramp up. Our next big project would be
brand new territory that will help drive forward a number of technical
initiatives and directions.

Loving a good challenge I am sad to not be able to be a part of this next step,
but felt it was important to follow through and join the rotation as planned.
Over the course of the current project I realized I am not very good at letting
things go without participating. This will be hard for me to not be in the
thick of it.

Hopefully I can stay in touch and learn what I can while the team progresses.
They are fantastic and I know they will do a great job at it.

Excitement
===============================================================================

TODO: What are you excited about
-> Learning!!!!

- More direct impact on education
- Being a better developer by reading other code
- Tackling the Monolith, making it a bit better
- Change of topic
- Slowing down a bit
- Working with new people and learning from them
- Getting out of silo

It should not come as a shock that I love change and learning new things. With
the problems and code I will be getting into this temporary placement is going
to be like drinking from a fire hose. The rotation will entail working on a code
base that I have limited knowledge of and is dauntingly large. It has been
maintained by hundreds of people for over five years with no signs of slowing
down.

This means that I will get to learn new things from old code. There will be the
good, the bad and the ugly. There will be things that are surprising. There
will things that make me cry. But through all this maybe, just maybe, I will
become a better developer. Reading code from others is like having a portal
into their thoughts. Why decisions were made is crucial to understanding why
some arcane incantation is the way it is and can only be gleaned from the code
itself.

Another unique aspect of the team is that everyone else is also on rotation.
This helps mix things up throughout the company and cross pollinate different
ideas. The wide mix of developers and testers on the team will invariably
result in different solutions that I would think up alone. Pairing and working
with others is fun and since everyone else is on their own ration I will
constantly get to work with new people.

While the projects I have been working on have a massive impact to the company
they tend to be internally focused and tools oriented. I find it very enriching
to help others and meeting internal needs is a great way to do just that. The
new projects I am working on will have direct links to our end users. Instead
of services and frameworks to optimize routine tasks I will be contributing to
complete applications.

The impact to individual users is more meaningful and tangible. Improving the
performance of a build or deployment by 10% doesn't help users understand their
courses better. Fixing a long standing issue or improving navigation might be
the difference a student needs to graduate.

In some ways this will be breaking out of our current development silo;
branching out to a different domain with different constraints and obstacles.
Despite working for an education company I feel I don't know very much about
our core business and how it works. I have focused very heavily on automation,
Continuous Delivery and enabling others at the expense of working on our core
product.

Prior to working at D2L I had a variety of co-op jobs and short consultant job
after university. We would always joke that after the first 4 months working
full time I would be ready for my co-op evaluation then ready for the next
school term. After landing a job at D2L, I decided I wanted to stick around and
work on my skills with larger projects. Each project has felt new and slowly
built on what came before, I feel I am ready for some change. I liked the
regular switch between school and employers. New work terms always meant new
adjustments and in a small way this rotation will be reminiscent of those
times.

TODO: slow down
Refreshing change of pace.


Better developer, Better coworker,  Refreshed and Motivated.


TODO: Clean up
One of my heroes, [Scott Hanselman][hanselman] often talks about becoming a
better developer by reading code. He has an entire category for
[Source Code][source] dedicated too amazing code samples he has posted
(One of my favourites was [Moq][moq]). I have been following for quite a while I like reading code and agree with Scott Hanselman
and Jeff Atwood

TODO: Not a great light for the company
I love a good challenge and I expect the upcoming months to be full of
surprises. The code I will be working in is definitely legacy code which means
extra care needs to be taken to preserve the behaviour. Using the broad
definition of code without tests is legacy code I excited to find ways to
safely enhance what is already there. This might sound silly but it is almost
like picking up litter, where you feel good afterwards for leaving the place
better than when you found it.

Ch-Ch-Changes!
===============================================================================

What does this change mean for wonderful readers like yourself?

Depending on the problems I get to dig into I might try to do more deep dive /
troubleshooting oriented posts. I have been working on a few posts where I take
a problem we encountered and take you through the entire story. Hopefully there
will be more like that and I am sure you will enjoy them too.

A crucial part of fixing issues will be testing and validation. It is one thing
to hack in something that work and another to prevent the problem for ever
happening again. Even with our current activities we have been exploring better
ways to validate our applications and deliver better quality products.

Topics like Continuous Delivery, deployment, automation and releasing software
will still be present but might not be as prominent until I return to my normal
team. You cannot completely change who you are and I am sure that I will try to
bring my need for simple and reliable releases to this new challenge.

Stick around. I think you are going to like it.
