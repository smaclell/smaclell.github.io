For the next 4 months, I will be joining a different team dedicated to making
our software better and addressing customer issues. I am excited for the change
and optimistic about the problems I will be solving.

In the fall the [company][d2l] I work for started implementing a rotation
program where developers throughout various teams would work on client facing
issues. This is a fantastic way to learn about our product and make a real
impact. Every team sends one developer for a standard rotation of 4 months and
the first set of developers are now returning to their original teams. I did
not get to participate the first time around, but excitedly volunteered to be
next in line.

FOMO - Fear of Missing Out
===============================================================================

Although it is now my turn to go I have been having trouble wrestling with a
distinct feeling of missing out. An extreme case of
<abbr title="Fear of Missing Out">FOMO</abbr> developed that I needed to
reason through.

My current team does amazing things that continue to shift how our company
operates and is at the helm of a very important project. We have hit a few
personal milestones and continue to ramp up. Our next big project would be
brand new territory that will help drive forward a number of technical
initiatives and directions.

Loving a good challenge I am sad to not be able to be a part of this next step,
but felt it was important to follow through and join the rotation as planned.
Over the course of the current project I realized I am not very good at letting
things go without participating. This will be hard for me to not be in the
thick of it.

Excited to Learn
===============================================================================

It should not come as a shock that I love change and learning new things. I am
excited about this new opportunity and the changes it brings. Hopefully,
I will learn many new things and become better developer as a result.

With the problems and code I will be getting into this temporary placement is
going to be like drinking from a fire hose. The rotation will entail working on
a code base that I have limited knowledge of and is dauntingly large. It has
been maintained by hundreds of people for over five years with no signs of
slowing down.

This means that I will get to learn new things from old code. There will be the
good, the bad and the ugly. There will be things that are surprising. There
will be things that make me cry. Through all this I hope to become a better
developer by being exposed to as much code as possible. This idea comes from
[Scott Hanselman][hanselman] and his infinite [Weekly Source Code][source]
series. Years ago he started this series and it has been fascinating to read
various code bases.

Another unique aspect of the team is that everyone else is also on rotation.
This helps mix things up throughout the company. Different teams do things
in their own way and cross pollinating all these developers and testers will
invariably help spread ideas. There will be plenty of pairing opportunities
and working along side diverse people as others move in and out of the team.

While the projects I have been working on have a massive impact to the company
they tend to be internally focused and tools oriented. The new projects I will
work have direct links to end users. In some ways this will be breaking out of
my current development silo; branching out to a different domain with
different constraints and obstacles.

The impact to individual users is more meaningful and tangible. Improving the
performance of a build or deployment by 10% doesn't help users understand their
courses better. Fixing a long standing issue or improving navigation might be
the difference a student needs to graduate.

I am optimistic about what the future holds and excited for this opportunity.
There will be many changes to learn new things and improve as developer. The
problem domain is motivating for me thanks to the potential to help others. I
an confident my experiences will pull me outside of my comfort zone in a good
way. It is going to be great.

Ch-Ch-Changes!
===============================================================================

What does this change mean for wonderful readers like yourself?

Depending on the problems I get to dig into I might try to do more deep dive /
troubleshooting oriented posts. I have been working on a few posts where I take
a problem we encountered and take you through the entire story. Hopefully there
will be more like that and I am sure you will enjoy them too.

A crucial part of fixing issues will be testing and validation. It is one thing
to hack in something that work and another to prevent the problem for ever
happening again. Even with our current activities we have been exploring better
ways to validate our applications and deliver better quality products.

Topics like Continuous Delivery, deployment, automation and releasing software
will still be present but might not be as prominent until I return to my normal
team. You cannot completely change who you are and I am sure that I will try to
bring my need for simple and reliable releases to this new challenge.

Stick around. I think you are going to like it.
