For the next 4 months, I will be joining a different team dedicated to making
our software better and addressing customer issues. I am excited for the change
and optimistic about the problems I will be solving.

In the fall the [company][d2l] I work for started implementing a rotation
program where developers throughout various teams would work on client facing
issues. This is a fantastic way to learn about our product and make a real
impact. Every team sends one developer for a standard rotation of 4 months and
the first set of developers are now returning to their original teams. I did
not get to participate the first time around, but excitedly volunteered to be
next in line.

FOMO - Fear of Missing Out
===============================================================================

Although it is now my turn to go I have been having trouble wrestling with a
distinct feeling of missing out. An extreme case of
<abbr title="Fear of Missing Out">FOMO</abbr> developed that I needed to
reason through.

My current team does amazing things that continue to shift how our company
operates and is at the helm of a very important project. We have hit a few
personal milestones and continue to ramp up. Our next big project would be
brand new territory that will help drive forward a number of technical
initiatives and directions.

Loving a good challenge I am sad to not be able to be a part of this next step,
but felt it was important to follow through and join the rotation as planned.
Over the course of the current project I realized I am not very good at letting
things go without participating. This will be hard for me to not be in the
thick of it. I am hoping to stay in touch with my current team and continue to
join in where I can.

Excitement
===============================================================================

It should not come as a shock that I love change and learning new things. This
temporary placement is going to be like drinking from a fire hose.

Ch-Ch-Changes!
===============================================================================

What does this change mean for wonderful readers like yourself?

Depending on the problems I get to dig into I might try to do more deep dive /
troubleshooting oriented posts. I have been working on a few posts where I take
a problem we encountered and take you through the entire story. Hopefully there
will be more like that and I am sure you will enjoy them too.

A crucial part of fixing issues will be testing and validation. It is one thing
to hack in something that work and another to prevent the problem for ever
happening again. Even with our current activities we have been exploring better
ways to validate our applications and deliver better quality products.

Topics like Continuous Delivery, deployment, automation and releasing software
will still be present but might not be as prominent until I return to my normal
team. You cannot completely change who you are and I am sure that I will try to
bring my need for simple and reliable releases to this new challenge.

Stick around. I think you are going to like it.
