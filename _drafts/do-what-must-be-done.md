This is going to be an interesting week. Deadlines are tights. Life is doesn't
stop and has more than its fair share of fun. Instead of bemoaning our lot I
have decided to do something about it. Work needs to get done and so we can
step up. We will do what must be done.

When things are not going well I think it can be easy to get demoralized. I
have learned I turn into a machine. Instead of curling up into a ball I focus
on getting stuff done. Emotions disengaged, it is time to get things done.

We have a whole bunch of things stacked against us this week. There have been
some surprises. People we count out are not available. Projects appearing and
demanding our attention. It will be a challenge, but I am excited to meet it
head on. Not only do I think we will get it all done, I think we will excel.

To add insult to injury we have adversity at home which will affect us for the
coming year.

This week I have decide to step up and do what must be done. I like to always
ask our team or myself were not to do something what would happen? Often I find
things I care about more than anyone else. If no one was to do the work I would
sad.
