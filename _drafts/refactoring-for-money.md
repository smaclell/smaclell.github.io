Refactoring is fun. Taking code and transforming how it fits together without
breaking can be art. Getting carried away with tweaking your code and
continuously refactoring can be a problem. Before you refactor it is really
important to know whether it will be worth it.

You are paid to think.

Plan on sticking around? Make an investment.
Critical Code? Keep it clean! Be careful.

Not sure? Do something small. Can you do something while you do your task? What about adding good tests or making the code testable?

Left for Dead.
Do not shuffle the deckchairs.

Today we walked away from a refactoring. We found some tests which did not work
as expected. Instead of spending time refactoring the code and dealing with the
problem it was better worth our time elsewhere.

Is this too points?
