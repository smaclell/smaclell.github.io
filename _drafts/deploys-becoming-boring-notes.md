Notes
=======================================

Draw the deployment pipeline
Don't describe feelings, describe actions.

Notes to self:

* Do no patronize
* There is only us
* Be humble
* No complaints
* Believe in the best intent
* Avoid editorializing the reactions of others
* Switch to lack of confidence instead of lack of trust
