Listening is important. If you spend all your time talking you will miss good
ideas. We have been working closely with another team who is coming up to
speed. They are joining us working on tools and problems we have spent years
building and supporting. This has been an interesting learning opportunity for
me. Instead of helping lead the project I need to shift to drawing out their
good ideas and support them.

Like many developers I want to solve problems. You know build cool stuff! This
normally involves rolling up my sleeves and diving in. I can choose how to
approach different problems and work with our team to get it done.

Lately, I have taken a backseat and have been supporting another team. We
had been lined up to work on a project with them. Due to logistics it was
decided the project would be easier if they lead the project. We would continue
to assist them and discuss different ideas, but not work directly on the
solution day to day. Ultimately they would do the majority of the development
and we would focus elsewhere.

Prior to the project starting we had spent a great deal of time thinking about
the overall problem and potential solutions. The code affected would integrate
heavily into what we are doing. Over time we have become subject matter experts
which has led to strong opinions about how things should be done.

However, to succeed on this project I need to put aside my own ideas and
listen. Instead of starting with my own opinion, I need to facilitate the
conversation so their ideas shine through. My co-worker Daryl put it
fantastically, "they have good ideas, we need to help draw them out".

The other team has great developers who are going to do a fantastic job. While
we might have a head start knowing the problem domain, they will be able to
come up to speed. We need to give them the space to solve their own
problems and to ask questions which will help them come to their own
solutions.

Arguing for my own ideas would be counter productive. The goal is not to show
off how smart we are or build up my ego. We could hand them over the master
plan we would have followed and missed the mark completely. It would
kill the project and crush any empowerment the other team has.

The point is to make the project a success and help our clients. Together, we
need to focus on shipping great software to meet the client needs.

Lately they have been wrestling through various challenges. It has been fun to
talk about potential options with them. They have been learning a lot and are
doing well.

Their solution looks different than how I pictured it in my mind and I think
that is fantastic! It shows they are finding their own path.

The great ideas are waiting and together we can draw them out.
