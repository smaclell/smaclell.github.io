How We Got Here
===============================================================================

Fast forward to our current project. We have broken up large chunks for the
work and given it to another team. Where we would typically have full control
we now need to give it up.

This has been hard for me. I was looking forward to this project for 6 months.
The entire time I was an [Exterminator][tribute] I was looking forward to
coming back to this project. Instead of leaving for my rotation I was
considering sticking around so I could start it sooner.

Not only would it be incredibly challenging technically, I thought this project
would be extremely rewarding. It will be a game changer.

When the project was ready to start we met with the other team to discuss
potential solutions. We white boarded different options. Bounced ideas off each
other. It was fun. We went out for sushi and didn't let Daryl order too much.

Afterwards, I built a prototype showcasing options for a potential solution. To
make it even more awesome, I pulled in some new technology I was excited about
using. My mini demo showed off the core aspects of what I would have built.

Shortly after I was done my prototype it was decided the other team would work
on the project alone. We would support them, but they would do the day to day
development.
