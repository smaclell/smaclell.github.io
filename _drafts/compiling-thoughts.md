I am not sure how you got here. It is great you made it, but things aren't
ready yet. Read on to discover why you will want to stick around.

Recently, I decided that I wanted to share more of the things I am learning.
It was after going to [DevOpsDays Toronto][devopsdaysto] that I realized
I wanted to do more. That weekend got me incredibly fired up about what we are
doing at [work][d2l] and the potential we have to make an impact. Each of the
fantastic sessions really struck a chord with me. I could not shake the idea
that the hard-fought lessons we learned are not too different than what
others encounter on their own journey.

From a very early age I wanted to help people, to truly care about others and
make a difference in their lives. With the billions of people on our planet,
I would hope that in some small way I could help unlock their creativity or
encourage their limitless potential. I didn't know how to act on this feeling
or a have means to scale what one person could do until I learned how to
program. It made me feel like I had super powers to create new worlds and do
things I never thought possible. An app or website can easily reach the whole
world and connect humanity more than anything else that has come before. The recent years
have taught me a great deal about software development and craftsmanship but I
still feel I have barely scratched the surface. Over time programming became a
new passion of mine for creating great software as a means to improve lives,
delight users and solve problems.

Earlier this year I welcomed my son Jude into the world and I cannot describe
in words the happiness he gives me. My hope is that I can be a role model for
him by sharing my passion for helping others and inspire him to achieve his
potential. It doesn't hurt that he is very cute and you will probably be
seeing more of this little guy.

In the coming weeks, months and hopefully years I would like to share the
journey I am going on and the things I am learning. Topics will cover
almost anything about creating and shipping software, from the first commit
to turning off a service forever. This will include an element of culture, as
I strongly believe that creating great things requires a team of passionate
individuals aligned to a common purpose. Lean and agile ideals resonate with me
and I will talk about how they have helped simplify the process of producing
sustainable value. Delivery pipelines, release management, continuous delivery
and similar topics will be usual offenders.

Things might not be regular at first thanks to the ups and down of life but I
will do my best to stay on track. I hope that you join me on this journey and
enjoy what I have to share. See you soon.
