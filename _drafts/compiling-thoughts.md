I am not sure how you got here. It is great you made it, but things aren't
exciting yet. Read on to discover why you will want to stick around.

Recently, I decided that I wanted to share more of the things I was learning.
It was after going to [DevOps Days Toronto][devopsdaysto] and that I realized
I wanted to do more. The weekend made me incredibly fired up about what doing
at my [job][d2l] and the potential we have to make an impact. After each of the
fantastic sessions really struck a chord with me. I could not shake the idea
that the hard fought lessons we had learned are not too different than what
others encounter on thier journey.

From a very early age I wanted to help people, to truly care about
others and make a difference in their lives. The creativity and potential
people have is limitless. In University I discovered that I really enjoyed
programming and automation. It made me feel like I had super powers to create
a brand new experience or new understanding. The years that have followed
taught me a great deal but I still feel I have barely scratched the surface.
This new passion for creating great software became a means to improve lives
and delight users.

Earlier this year I welcomed my son, Jude, into the world and cannot describe
in words the happiness he gives me. My hope is that I can be a role model for
him by sharing my passion for helping others and inspire him to achieve his
potential. It doesn't hurt that he is very cute and you will probably be
seeing more this little guy.

In the coming weeks, months and hopefully years I would like to share the
journey I am going through and the things I am learning. Topics will cover
almost anything about creating and shipping software, from the first commit
to turning off a service forever. This will include an element of culture, as
I strongly believe that creating great things requires a team of passionate
individuals aligned to a common purpose. Lean and agile ideals resonate with me
and I will talk about how they have helped simplify the process of producing
sustainable value. Delivery pipelines, release management, continuous delivery
and similar topics will be usual offenders.

Things might not be regular at first thanks to the ups and down of life but I
will do my best to stay on track. I hope that you join me on this journey and
enjoy what I have to share. See you soon.
