I am not sure how you got here. It is great you made it, but things aren't
exciting yet. Read on to discover why you will want to stick around.

Recently, I decided that I wanted to share more of the things I was learning.
It was after going to [DevOps Days Toronto][devopsdaysto] and that I realized
that I wanted to do more. The weekend made me incredibly fired up about what
doing at my [job][d2l] and the potential we have to make an impact. After each
of the fantastic sessions I felt like our own experiences echoed what I was
hearing from others. I could not shake the idea that the hard fought lessons we
had learned aren't the same things others encounter on a simliar journey.

From a very early age I wanted to be able to help people. To truly care about
others and make a difference in their lives. The creativity and potential
people have is limitless. In University I discovered that I really enjoyed
programming and automation. It made me feel like I had super powers to create
a brand new experience or new understanding. In the years that have followed
I feel like I have both learned alot and have barely scratched the surface.
I am passionate about creating great software as means to improve lives and
delight users.

Earlier this year I welcomed my son, Jude, into the world and cannot describe
in words the happiness he gives me. My hope is that I can be a role model for
him by sharing my passion for helping others and inspire him to achieve his
potential. It doesn't hurt that he is very cute and you will probably be
seeing more this little guy.

In the coming weeks, months and hopefully years I would like to share the
journey I am going through and the things I am learning. There are a alot of
things I would like to write about and I will probably cover a great deal in
the software development life cycle from first commit to when the system is
being decommisioned. programming, testing, operating and deploying software.
Including changes in how I understand building, architecting, operating and
deploying software into the wild. This will include an element of culture as
I strongly believe that creating great things needs a team of passionate
individuals aligned to a common purpose. There will be an element of
lean/agile philosophy and where it helps simplify the process of producing
sustainable value. Continuous delivery, release management and similiar topic
will be unsual offenders.

Things might not be regular at first and I am sure Jude will have something to
say about it but I hope that you stick around. Enjoy.
