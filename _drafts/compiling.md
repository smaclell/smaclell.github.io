I am not sure how you got here. It is great you made it, but things aren't exciting yet. Read on to get a discover why you will want to stick around.

Recently, I decided that I wanted to share more of the things I was learning. It was after going to [DevOps Days Toronto][devopsdaysto] and that I realized that I wanted to do more. The weekend made me incredibly fired up about what doing at my [job][d2l] and the potential we have to make an impact. After each of the fantastic sessions I felt like our own experiences echoed what I was hearing from others. I could not shake the idea that the hard fought lessons we had learned aren't the same things others encounter on a simliar journey.

Making software that can make a difference is one of my passions. Creating something new that improves the lives of others is a gift. Earlier this year I welcomed my son, Jude, into the world and cannot describe in words the joy he gives me. My hope is that I can be a role model for him by sharing my passion for helping others and inspire him to achieve full his potential. It doesn't hurt that he is very cute and you will probably be seeing more this little guy.

In the coming weeks, months and hopefully years I would like to share the journey I am going through on how I understand the ways that software can be archictected, operated and deployed. This will include an element of culture as I strongly believe that creating great things needs a team of passionate individuals. I believe strongly in alot of lean/agile philosophies in order to produce a product that continues to provide value sustainably over time. Things might not be regular at first and I am sure Jude will have something to say about it but I hope that you stick around enjoy.
