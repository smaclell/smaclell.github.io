A highlight of my second week as an [Extermintor][tribute] was writing down my
goals for the year. This year felt different. As I worked on it, I focused all
my effort trying to understand why I felt these goals were important and what
fundamental aspects of me they could change. The finished product felt great
and to keep me honest I have decided to share them here with you.

Unlike previous goals where I wanted to learn a new technology or tackle a new
project I decided to focus on habits I wanted to improve. While my usual goals
are fun and challenging they don't go deep. Lasting habits are hard to form and
easy to lose.

The two areas I picked were **Focus** and **Quality**.

Why
===============================================================================

Do you aspire to be more than you are? Put your heart and soul into everything
you do? I hope you do.

I believe everyone has a unique talent or gift to share with the world.
Improving at you want to do can help you do more. If you are passionate about
your cause then it makes perfect sense that you would want to be better at
anything related to it.

I don't think I am a particularly gifted programmer. In fact, I think I am just
okay. However, I don't see this as a limitation instead as an area for
continuously improving. Where I am good I can become better and I can work on
filling the gaps ever where else.

I like to think of self improvement as a never ending journey. You can always
get better and change small pieces of yourself. With enough effort and
willpower I think you can change anything. Every year I like to push myself
with a new challenge or goal.

If you want to be an essential [lynchpin][Lynchpin] then I think it is critical
you are always improving. To push the boundary on your potential I think it is
very important to choose wisely what to try to improve on.

Focus
===============================================================================

Being able to block out the world and focus on one thing is a skill. Getting
work done can be improved when it is the only activity vying for your time.
When many people focus on the same goal together they can achieve much more
than any single individual ever could.

People who are [smart and get things done][smart] or the even more elusive
[done and gets things smart][done] do what they need to in order to get stuff
done. Most of the time I think I am productive compared the average person. The
rest of the time I often find myself distracted or switching between various
activities.

Even though I am getting things done and often leaving them better than when I
found them I think there is a higher plateau I could reach. If I could
sustainably increase my focus on finish what I am working on sooner I would
have higher productivity. Instead of juggling many half done things would
ensure I am getting things to a completely finished state before taking on more
work and/or moving onto the next activity.

Quality
===============================================================================

Number 3?
===============================================================================

There is no number three. I was asked whether I was going to include another
goal several times and felt anything else would detract for the original two.
