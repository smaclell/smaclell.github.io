TODO: You totally lost Angela right here. She had to fish to get through it.

A highlight of my second week as an [Exterminator][tribute] was thinking about
my career goals for this year. This is an annual activity and this time around
I tried to approach it differently.

This year I tried to focus on why I felt these goals were important and what
fundamental aspects of me they could improve. The finished product felt great
and to keep me honest I have decided to share them with you here.

Unlike previous goals to learn a new technology or tackle a new
project I decided to pick habits I wanted to improve. While my usual goals
are fun and challenging they don't go deep. Lasting habits are hard to form and
easy to lose. By intentionally trying to live our these new habits every day I
believe I can create a lasting change.

The two habits I picked to improve were my ability to **[Focus](#focus)** and
attention to **[Quality](#quality)**.

Why Set Annual Goals?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I believe everyone has a unique talent or gift to share with the world.
Developing your skills is a great way to increase what you are capable of
achieving. Whether it is cultivating an expertise or filling a gap there are
always ways to improve yourself.

Improvement is a never-ending journey. For every new thing you learn you can
always learn more and go deeper. You can even change
habits and routines with enough effort. Instead of standing still I think
it is critical to be constantly learning and pushing yourself.

Being a developer right now is exciting with new opportunities and an ever
shifting industry. There
are always new techniques, libraries and projects to learn from. I don't think
you need some innate talent to be a developer, or that programming skills are something you
are born with. If you want to be an amazing developer, you can do it with
enough effort and dedication.

I want to be an amazing developer so I can solve bigger problems and help more people.
I don't have it all together and have much to learn, but I am excited to try.

Fluff -> You are not saying much of anything. No meet yet.
Always be improving
I want to be a better developer

Inspiration Behind My Goals
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last year I started reading [Dan Blumenthal's][dan] blog and found it to be a
treasure trove for career advice. Dan has a very insightful series on [mastery][mastery]
which has inspired me to become better at my job. Here are the links to the
series. Go read it, I'll wait.

* [How "Senior" Software Engineers are Different][different]
* [Anti-Mastery][anti-mastery] (a.k.a guaranteed ways to not be awesome)
* [Mastering the Basics][basics]
* [Intermediate Mastery][intermediate]
* [Mastery][mastery]

Welcome back!

TODO: Summarize the Series. Necessary skills and Getting things done and doing them well are key ideas throughout
the series.

Previous
Doing great work and focusing on what needs to be done are key ideas throughout
the series. Beyond the basic skills gained over time, Focus and Quality are two
fundamental areas I felt I need to improve. Right now I think I am okay in both
these areas, but if I were to make them into habits I could be much better.

Beyond continuing to build my skills and gain experience, Focus and Quality are two
fundamental areas where I feel I need to improve.

Before reading Dan's series the only benchmarks I had for my abilities were other
developers and Joel Spolsky's classic blog post about only hiring people who are
[smart and get things done][smart].
Every thinks they are already there. They are already part of the crowd of
people who are both smart and get things done. I hope I am, but I never really
know. The series challenges you to go deeper and understand much more. In the
final post he alludes to what might exist at the final level or who Steve Yegge
calls those who are [done and gets things smart][done]. I don't know if I have
what it takes, but I want to try to get to that final level.

From this series, thinking about where I was struggling and talking as a team I
then settled on the two habits I wanted to foster over the coming year.

Focus
===============================================================================

Work in progress is not done and only when we are completely done is what we
are doing valuable for our clients. Building great software requires dedicated
focus and attention which is impossible if you are juggling many different
tasks or projects.

Being able to block out the world and focus on one thing is a skill. Getting
work done can be improved when it is the only activity vying for your time.
When many people focus on the same goal together they can achieve much more
than any single individual ever could.

Focus for me means working on a few tasks at a time that deliver value. Value
is a loose definition encompassing helpings others, pushing to master a usable
piece or sharing knowledge. The bigger the impact to customers the better.
Doing fewer tasks a time means I can pour all of my attention into a small area
to completely finish whatever needs to be done.

Another side effect of intense focus is I will be able to learn faster. I have
tried to cultivate a wider range of skills normally peripheral to developing
products. My opportunity with [Exterminators][tribute] allows me to hone my
developer skills on an endless stream of small projects. Focusing on only one
project at a time will let me learn as much as I can then move on to the next
one.

How am I going to get there?

**By doing fewer things**

* Understand and reduce my work in progress
* Before July first read and apply the book [Getting Things Done][gtd]
* Complete small tasks immediately not as an interruption
* Break up larger tasks into small tasks that provide value
* Do one project at a time

**Eliminating distractions**

* Less time performing status updates (email, task tracking, etc.)
* Less checking email and no email alerts
* Fewer meetings and more collaborative sessions
* At least one Work From Home data weekly

Do fewer things at a time. Do each thing amazingly. Learn. Repeat.

Quality
===============================================================================

Do you like defects? I don't. I like it when programs I am using work every
time.

Customers deserve software that behaves as intended and is free of major
defects. I want to build products users love and trust, are simple to support and
can easily grow over time. Build the right products and build them right.

Shortcuts can add up and begin to bog down projects. Just like in life if you
eat too much junk food you won't be very healthy. Code needs a good diet of
tests, refactoring and maintenance. Even the smallest change can be risky
and if a code base has been left to fend for itself the risks are even greater.

It can be impossible to know exactly what people need before trying to build a
solution to solve their problem. I believe the best solutions are emergent and
the product of iterating repeatedly with guidance from stakeholders.

This is where my view of quality comes from. Balancing the pace of innovation
with the risk of introducing regressions while aspiring to technical excellence.

With one of our recent projects we decided to have zero defects. We would
decide whether a new issue coming in was to be fixed or not immediately. If we
(us and our clients) thought it was important we would fix it right away.
Otherwise the issue would be left alone and we would continue onto more
important work.

Prior to starting this we had a backlog of defects. This surprised me because I
thought we were doing such a great job and our quality was excellent. Talking
about the actual number of defects and problems encountered has made me realize
I was wrong.

Looking more closely we had many areas that were difficult for our clients or
caused them more work. There were some issues we didn't think were a big deal
that meant a lot to them. We were missing opportunities to work better with our
clients and improve the entire system.

Fewer defects and the trust gained from working together more effectively would
allow us to iterate faster and build the most optimal with less effort. Less
defects would mean spending less time now revisiting old solutions and focusing
on new improvements. We had tried to move too quickly before and created
defects as a result which has ultimately slowed us down with the extra maintenance.

Starting to burn down our defects has caused me to think about how I can
prevent defects from being introduced and lower the risk of any change I make.
I think we can have fewer defects and create safer systems. In order to achieve
this I thought up the following practices I could do to improve the quality of
the code I write:

* Include high quality automated tests with all new development
* Increase automated testing for existing solutions
* More in-depth validation prior to pushing code
* Favour quality and understanding over speed
* More analysis of proposed work to identify how to ship smaller pieces
* Better collaboration with Testers and Product Owners throughout development/testing

Number 3?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is no number three. I was asked whether I was going to include another
goal several times and felt anything else would detract for the original two.

These goals complement and balance each other well. If I try to focus solely on
productivity my quality will suffer and if I am spending all my time on minute
details I will not be getting enough done.

Making Myself Accountable
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The trick with both my goals is to follow through. There is no secret formula
and what happens now is I need to live them out. I want to be part of the
minority who achieve their goals, unlike [New Year's resolutions][stats].

I need help to get there. You can help me by asking about how my goals are
doing and telling me about your own. Talking about my goals reinforces why I am
trying to do them. Thinking about them more often helps reinforce the habits
and make sure they are here to stay. I tend to be inspired by passionate people
and if you are excited about what you are doing I would love to talk about it.

Please, keep me accountable to sticking with my habits. What are your goals and
aspirations?
