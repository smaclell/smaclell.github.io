A highlight of my second week as an [Extermintor][tribute] was writing down my
goals for the year. This year felt different. As I worked on it, I focused all
my effort trying to understand why I felt these goals were important and what
fundamental aspects of me they could change. The finished product felt great
and to keep me honest I have decided to share them here with you.

Unlike previous goals where I wanted to learn a new technology or tackle a new
project I decided to focus on habits I wanted to improve. While my usual goals
are fun and challenging they don't go deep. Lasting habits are hard to form and
easy to lose.

The two areas I picked were **Focus** and **Quality**.

Why
===============================================================================

Do you aspire to be more than you are? Put your heart and soul into everything
you do? I hope you do.

I believe everyone has a unique talent or gift to share with the world.
Improving at you want to do can help you do more. If you are passionate about
your cause then it makes perfect sense that you would want to be better at
anything related to it.

I don't think I am a particularly gifted programmer. In fact, I think I am just
okay. However, I don't see this as a limitation instead an area where I can
always improve. Where I am good I can become better and I can work on filling
the gaps ever where else.

I like to think of self improvement as a never ending journey. You can always
get better and change small pieces of yourself.

Focus
===============================================================================

Quality
===============================================================================

Number 3?
===============================================================================

There is no number three. I was asked whether I was going to include another
goal several times and felt anything else would detract for the original two.
