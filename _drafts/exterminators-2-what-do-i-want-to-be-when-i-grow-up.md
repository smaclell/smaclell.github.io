A highlight of my second week as an [Extermintor][tribute] was writing down my
goals for the year. This year felt different. As I worked on it, I focused all
my effort trying to understand why I felt these goals were important and what
fundamental aspects of me they could change. The finished product felt great
and to keep me honest I have decided to share them here with you.

Unlike previous goals where I wanted to learn a new technology or tackle a new
project I decided to focus on habits I wanted to improve. While my usual goals
are fun and challenging they don't go deep. Lasting habits are hard to form and
easy to lose.

The two areas I picked were **[Focus](#focus)** and **[Quality](#quality)**.

Why
===============================================================================

Do you aspire to be more than you are? Put your heart and soul into everything
you do? I hope you do.

I believe everyone has a unique talent or gift to share with the world.
Improving at you want to do can help you do more. If you are passionate about
your cause then it makes perfect sense that you would want to be better at
anything related to it.

Improvement is a never ending journey. For every new thing you learn you can
always learn more and continue to get better. You can even try to change
habits and routines with enough effort. Instead of standing still I think
it is critical to be constantly learning and pushing yourself.

Being a developer is exciting and an area where I always can get better. There
are always new techniques, libraries and projects to learn from. I don't think
I have some innate talent for being a developer or skills are something people
are born with. I think if you want to be an amazing developer you can with
enough effort and dedication.

I want to be an amazing developer so I can solve problems and help others.
The internal motivation to be a better developer and deliver better products
is what drives me to improve.

Inspiration
===============================================================================

Last year I started reading [Dan Blumenthal's][dan] blog and have found it a
treasure trove for career advice.

Talk about the series. http://dandreamsofcoding.com/2013/05/23/mastery/


People who are [smart and get things done][smart] or the even more elusive
[done and gets things smart][done] do what they need to in order to get stuff
done.

I believe there are two types of people, doers and talkers. If I want to be a
doer and that means I need to focus on getting things done.

Focus
===============================================================================

Work in progress is not done and only when we are completely done is what we
are doing valuable for our clients. Building great software requires dedicated
focus and attention which is impossible if you are juggling many different
tasks or projects.

Being able to block out the world and focus on one thing is a skill. Getting
work done can be improved when it is the only activity vying for your time.
When many people focus on the same goal together they can achieve much more
than any single individual ever could.

Focus for me means working on a few tasks at a time that deliver value. Value
is a loose definition encompassing helpings others, pushing to master a usable
piece or sharing knowledge. The bigger the impact to customers the better.
Doing fewer tasks a time means I can pour all of my attention into a small area
to completely finish whatever needs to be done.

Another side effect of intense focus is I will be able to learn faster. I have
tried to cultivate a wider range of skills normally peripheral to developing
products. My opportunity with [Exterminators][tribute] allows me to hone my
developer skills on an endless stream of small projects. Focusing on only one
project at a time will let me learn as much as I can then move on to the next
one.

How am I going to get there?

**By doing fewer things**

* Understand and reduce my work in progress
* Before July first read and apply the book [Getting Things Done][gtd]
* Complete small tasks immediately not as an interruption
* Break up larger tasks into small tasks that provide value
* Do one project at a time

**Eliminating distractions**

* Less time performing status updates (email, task tracking, etc.)
* Less checking email and no email alerts
* Fewer meetings and more collaborative sessions
* At least one Work From Home data weekly

Do fewer things at a time. Do each thing amazingly. Learn. Repeat.

Quality
===============================================================================

Delivering software which exceeds client expectations and functions as designed
is fundamental. Trust builds slowly with reliable and defect free releases. It
is really hard to be delighted when software you use every day doesn't do what
you expect.

For a long time time I thought speed was one of the most important parts of
releasing quality software. Using an extremely fast release cycle you can learn
much faster thanks to having more releases in the same period of time. Small
rapid increments to add or remove functionality as fast as possible.

The flip side is that for every change there is a potential for defects to
occur. This has caused me to revise my thinking around rapid releases. Fast
releases are great, but you want to avoid fast trash. Without reliability
the entire process can unravel quickly.

Our track record for our previous projects has been very good and I think we
can do even better. I am confident we can release frequently with confidence
thanks to comprehensive testing and putting quality first.

While on [Exterminators][tribute] I have been exposed to different code bases
where I am less comfortable. Again I feel I need to be more mindful of what
I am doing while ensuring that no defects occur both now and in the future.

One exciting aspect of working on this team is we have dedicated testers. My
previous team was an anomaly because we did not have any testers on the team.
To compensate the team doubled down on automated testing and developers would
perform any additional testing. Working with dedicated testers will help
uncover more scenarios and help identify risks.

How am I going to change my normal development?

* Include high quality automated tests with all new development
* Increase automated testing for existing solutions
* More in-depth validation prior to pushing code
* Favour quality and understanding over speed
* More analysis of proposed work to identify how to ship smaller pieces
* Better collaboration with Testers and Product Owners throughout development/testing

Number 3?
===============================================================================

There is no number three. I was asked whether I was going to include another
goal several times and felt anything else would detract for the original two.

These goals complement and balance each other well. If I try to focus solely on
productivity my quality will suffer and if I am spending all my time on minute
details I will not be getting enough done.

Keep Me Accountable
===============================================================================

The trick with both my goals is to follow through. There is no secret formula
and what happens now is I need to live them out. I want to be part of the
minority who achieve their goals, unlike [New Year's resolutions][stats]. 

I need help to get there. You can help me by asking about how my goals are
doing and telling me about your own. Talking about my goals reinforces why I am
trying to do them. Thinking about them more often helps reinforce the habits
and make sure they are hear to stay. I tend to be inspired by passionate people
and if you are excited about what you are doing I would love to talk about it.

Please, keep me accountable to sticking with my habits. What are your goals and
aspirations?
