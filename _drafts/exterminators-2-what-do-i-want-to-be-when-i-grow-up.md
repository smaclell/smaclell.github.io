A highlight of my second week as an [Extermintor][tribute] was writing down my
goals for the year. This year felt different. As I worked on it, I focused all
my effort trying to understand why I felt these goals were important and what
fundamental aspects of me they could change. The finished product felt great
and to keep me honest I have decided to share them here with you.

Unlike previous goals where I wanted to learn a new technology or tackle a new
project I decided to focus on habits I wanted to improve. While my usual goals
are fun and challenging they don't go deep. Lasting habits are hard to form and
easy to lose.

The two areas I picked were **[Focus](#focus)** and **[Quality](#quality)**.

Why
===============================================================================

Do you aspire to be more than you are? Put your heart and soul into everything
you do? I hope you do.

I believe everyone has a unique talent or gift to share with the world.
Improving at you want to do can help you do more. If you are passionate about
your cause then it makes perfect sense that you would want to be better at
anything related to it.

Improvement is a never ending journey. For every new thing you learn you can
always learn more and continue to get better. You can even try to change
habits and routines with enough effort. Instead of standing still I think
it is critical to be constantly learning and pushing yourself.

Being a developer is exciting and an area where I always can get better. There
are always new techniques, libraries and projects to learn from. I don't think
I have some innate talent for being a developer or skills are something people
are born with. I think if you want to be an amazing developer you can with
enough effort and dedication.

I want to be an amazing developer so I can solve problems and help others.
The internal motivation to be a better developer and deliver better products
is what drives me to improve.

Inspiration
===============================================================================

Last year I started reading [Dan Blumenthal's][dan] blog and have found it a
treasure trove for career advice.

Talk about the series. http://dandreamsofcoding.com/2013/05/23/mastery/


People who are [smart and get things done][smart] or the even more elusive
[done and gets things smart][done] do what they need to in order to get stuff
done.

I believe there are two types of people, doers and talkers. If I want to be a
doer and that means I need to focus on getting things done.

Focus
===============================================================================

Work in progress is not done and only when we are completely done is what we
are doing valuable for our clients. Building great software requires dedicated
focus and attention which is impossible if you are juggling many different
tasks or projects.

Being able to block out the world and focus on one thing is a skill. Getting
work done can be improved when it is the only activity vying for your time.
When many people focus on the same goal together they can achieve much more
than any single individual ever could.

Focus for me means working on a few tasks at a time that deliver value. Value
is a loose definition encompassing helpings others, pushing to master a usable
piece or sharing knowledge. The bigger the impact to customers the better.
Doing fewer tasks a time means I can pour all of my attention into a small area
to completely finish whatever needs to be done.

Another side effect of intense focus is I will be able to learn faster. I have
tried to cultivate a wider range of skills normally peripheral to developing
products. My opportunity with [Exterminators][tribute] allows me to hone my
developer skills on an endless stream of small projects. Focusing on only one
project at a time will let me learn as much as I can then move on to the next
one.

How am I going to get there?

**By doing fewer things**

* Understand and reduce my work in progress
* Before July first read and apply the book [Getting Things Done][gtd]
* Complete small tasks immediately not as an interruption
* Break up larger tasks into small tasks that provide value
* Do one project at a time

**Eliminating distractions**

* Less time performing status updates (email, task tracking, etc.)
* Less checking email and no email alerts
* Fewer meetings and more collaborative sessions
* At least one Work From Home data weekly

Do fewer things at a time. Do each thing amazingly. Learn. Repeat.

Quality
===============================================================================

Do you like defects? I don't. I like it when programs I am using work every
time.

Customers deserve software that behaves as intended and is free of major
defects. I want to build products users love and trust, are simple to support and
can easily grow over time. Build the right products and build them right.

Shortcuts can add up and begin to bog down projects. Just like in life if you
eat too much junk food you won't be very healthy. Code needs a good diet of
tests tests, refactoring and maintenance. Even the smallest change can be risky
and if a code base has been left to fend for itself the risks are even greater.

It can be impossible to know exactly what people need before trying to build a
solution to solve their problem. I believe the best solutions are emergent and
the product of iterating repeatedly with guidance from stakeholders.

This is where my view of quality comes from. Balancing the pace of innovation
with the risk of introducing regressions while aspiring to technical excellence.

With one of our recent projects we decided to have zero defects. We would
decide whether a new issue coming in was to be fixed or not immediately. If we
(us and our clients) thought it was important we would fix it right away.
Otherwise the issue would be left alone and we would continue onto more
important work.

Prior to starting this we had a backlog of defects. This surprised me because I
thought we were doing such a great job and our quality was excellent. Talking
about the actual number of defects and problems encountered has made me realize
I was wrong.

Looking more closely we had many areas that were difficult for our clients or
caused them more work. There were some issues we didn't think were a big deal
that meant a lot to them. We were missing opportunities to work better with our
clients and improve the entire system.

Fewer defects and the trust gained from working together more effectively would
allow us to iterate faster and build the most optimal with less effort. Less
defects would mean spending less time now revisiting old solutions and focusing
on new improvements. We had tried to move too quickly before and created
defects as a result which has ultimately slowed us down with the extra maintenance.

Starting to burn down our defects has caused me to think about how I can
prevent defects from being introduced and lower the risk of any change I make.
I think we can have fewer defects and create safer systems. In order to achieve
this I thought up the following practices I could do to improve the quality of
the code I write:

* Include high quality automated tests with all new development
* Increase automated testing for existing solutions
* More in-depth validation prior to pushing code
* Favour quality and understanding over speed
* More analysis of proposed work to identify how to ship smaller pieces
* Better collaboration with Testers and Product Owners throughout development/testing

Derp
===============================================================================

This year I want to be mindful of the risks introduced by my changes, cause
fewer defects and improve my technical excellence.

This includes reducing the amount of rework required and better
meeting client expectations.






You can mitigate those risks with testing and understanding the impact your changes might have.

Better software quality means less rework, happier customers and trust.
I want to improve the quality I want to improve the quality of the  I want to build software that works now. We want to be  Trust

To delight customers, I want to build the right products in the right way.
Any changes I make should improve the code I am working on without taking
shortcuts to finish early. Beating expectations and functioning as expected should be a given for any
product. Trust between teams and users builds slowly with reliable and defect
free releases.

Needless to say I think releasing quality products is important. Quality is a
slipper subject with different definitions for different people. The definition
I like best came from a former coworker of mine [Paul Carvalho][paul]:

> Quality is value to some person.

The question is who you want to provide value for first. End users are obvious
candidates. Other developers in 6 months who have to maintain your code.
Everyone attached to the product might have a say. Lately, I have been thinking
about minimizing risk, preventing regressions, improving reliability and
simplifying operations.

In the past I thought
the best way to do this was to understand the user requirements and iterate as
fast as possible. Faster releases mean more feedback and uncovering exactly
what the clients truly need from the initial requirements. Growing software
incremental like this is great fun and can continue for as long as needed.

The challenge with rapid releases is the potential for introducing defects
along with the intended features. Releases need to also be safe to avoid
creating fast trash.

Our track record for our previous projects has been very good and I think we
can do even better. I am confident we can release frequently with confidence
thanks to comprehensive testing and putting quality first. This means
prioritizing our client needs for stability and reducing the risks introduced
by new features or bug fixes.

While on [Exterminators][tribute] I have been exposed to different code bases
where I am less comfortable. Again I feel I need to be more mindful of what
I am doing while ensuring that no defects occur from my changes and in the
future. Understanding the risks any changes introduce and mitigating them in a
sustainable fashion.

My new team has several dedicated testers and I am looking forward to working
with them to ensure what I am building delivers the best value for our clients.
In the past I have focused almost exclusively on automated testing with not
nearly enough user testing. While this was great for test coverage it did not
ensure what I was building was easy to use or the user interface worked as
intended.

In the past I feel like my "Speed Wins" style caused me to accidentally cause
defects or resulted in products users felt were not ready yet.

Number 3?
===============================================================================

There is no number three. I was asked whether I was going to include another
goal several times and felt anything else would detract for the original two.

These goals complement and balance each other well. If I try to focus solely on
productivity my quality will suffer and if I am spending all my time on minute
details I will not be getting enough done.

Keep Me Accountable
===============================================================================

The trick with both my goals is to follow through. There is no secret formula
and what happens now is I need to live them out. I want to be part of the
minority who achieve their goals, unlike [New Year's resolutions][stats]. 

I need help to get there. You can help me by asking about how my goals are
doing and telling me about your own. Talking about my goals reinforces why I am
trying to do them. Thinking about them more often helps reinforce the habits
and make sure they are hear to stay. I tend to be inspired by passionate people
and if you are excited about what you are doing I would love to talk about it.

Please, keep me accountable to sticking with my habits. What are your goals and
aspirations?
