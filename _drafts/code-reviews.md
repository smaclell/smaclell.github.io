This week I helped perform several code reviews. I think code reviews are a
fantastic way to share best practices, check for logical errors and help
improve our code. They have become a standard practice for many teams. While on
the [Exterminators][tribute] I have the privilege to do code reviews with other
people who have a different code reviewing style than my own. This has caused
me to reflect on what I think are the most important aspects of code reviews
and what to look for when doing them.

As with programming there can be many styles of code reviews. No one style is
better than another. Different approaches have different advantages and
disadvantages.

Sharing, Learning and Communicating
===============================================================================

I did many many code reviews this week.
What do I look for?

Logic
===============================================================================

Code reviews are one of the few times you can evaluate code for logical issues.
Fundamental flaws with how algorithms fit together or are used. Humans make
horrible compilers and computers cannot truly understand how code is related.

Understand Why
===============================================================================

TODO - Question mark

- Not QA
- Not enough
- How thorough?
- How big?
- Substance not style
- Learning
- Sharing
- Testing
- Communicating
- Not an interrogation
- Not the grammar police
