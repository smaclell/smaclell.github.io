If you had to pick one thing to include in your new project what would it be?
Would it be that killer feature your clients are crazy about? Something that
separates you from the competition?

That sounds great. I would love to be able to use it but  you need to deploy it
first! Before any user can see your new wonderous creation you need to be able
to deploy your software to a prod like environment. It doesn't have to be
pretty; it just has to work.

All to often being able to deploy software is thought of as an afterthought.
Building that cool idea takes the for thought but don't you want to share it?
We have worked with a few teams lately who have gotten fairly far down the
development path before trying to settle on how they would deploy their new
product. Up until now they had been testing on developer boxes and did not see
any problems with this.

The inverse would be building that one killer feature and just enough to ship
it. Depending on your product that minimum point might be a little further but
typically it is earlier than you would think. By focusing on this minimum you
can start to iterate and improve what you have by adding to the initial
release. A new feature here, smoothing out the operations experience, expanding
the initial focus further or any number of paths that make sense. The pressure
of remainning releasable, focusing on the why will ideally help keep your
minimum viable product on track and help you build it the right way as shown by
Bill Gross via Andrew Wilkinson.

It is all too easy to go down a dark path and spend all your time polishing the
features that you hope to ship some day. By focusing on releasing early as soon
as you have enough functionality and can deploy you can deploy it and get
feedback. This feedback and learning is one of the central ideas behind
[Lean Startup][startup].

Please, the next time you start a new project, pick that one key feature then
build it along with a simple deployment process and share it with the world.
