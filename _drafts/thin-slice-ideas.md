TODO: Move this earlier as initial thoughts

It was surprising how as we kept going the momentum we gained. We have
continued trying this approach with other changes and it feels like we cannot
go fast enough.

* Legacy code? Start with tests!
* Prototype. Then throw it away.
* New code beside the old code then cut over.
* Automated testing covering your changes.
* Test throughout.
* Separate refactoring.
* Separate setup steps.
* Separate clean up.
* The more pull requests the merrier!
