A highlight of my second week as an [Exterminator][tribute] was thinking about
my career goals for this year. Instead of goals I decided on two habits I want
to establish that would improve my abilities the most, the ability to
**[Focus](#focus)** and attention to **[Quality](#quality)**.

This is an annual activity and this time around I tried to approach it
differently. Instead of thinking up a laundry list to learn or do I decided to
work on habits that will help me become a better developer. Throughout the
process I tried to concentrate on why I wanted to improve and why to improve
these specific areas.

Unlike previous goals to learn a new technology or tackle a new
project I decided to pick habits I wanted to improve. While my usual goals
are fun and challenging they don't go deep. I want to create lasting habits are
and keep them for the whole year. By intentionally trying to live out these new
habits every day I believe I can create a lasting change to how I work.

In order to keep me accountable I decided this is what I would share from this
week as an Exterminator<sup id="ext2-note-1-reverse"><a href="#ext2-note-1">1</a></sup>.

Why Set Annual Goals?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I believe everyone has a unique talent or gift to share with the world.
Developing your skills is a great way to increase what you are capable of
achieving. Whether it is cultivating an expertise or filling a gap there are
always ways to improve yourself.

Improvement is a never-ending journey. For every new thing you learn you can
always learn more and go deeper. You can even change
habits and routines with enough effort. Instead of standing still I think
it is critical to be constantly learning and pushing yourself.

Being a developer right now is exciting with new opportunities and an ever
shifting industry. There
are always new techniques, libraries and projects to learn from. I don't think
you need some innate talent to be a developer, or that programming skills are something you
are born with. If you want to be an amazing developer, you can do it with
enough effort and dedication.

I want to be an amazing developer so I can solve bigger problems and help more people.
I don't have it all together and have much to learn, but I am excited to try.

Inspiration Behind My Goals
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last year I started reading [Dan Blumenthal's][dan] blog and found it to be a
treasure trove for career advice. Dan has a very insightful series on [mastery][mastery]
which has inspired me to become better at my job. Here are the links to the
series. Go read it, I'll wait.

1. [How "Senior" Software Engineers are Different][different]
2. [Anti-Mastery][anti-mastery] (a.k.a guaranteed ways to not be awesome)
3. [Mastering the Basics][basics]
4. [Intermediate Mastery][intermediate]
5. [Mastery][mastery]

Welcome back!

This series outlines many important fundamentals to being a developer. Many
take a long amount of exposure and time to learn. Others are habits or how you
go about your work. The final post shows insights into what might be required
to become a truly epic developer.

The ability to Focus shows up on the [Mastery][mastery] list and aspects of
Quality or lack thereof are on the [Anti-Mastery][anti-mastery] list. After
watching other developers I respect I realized that they ooze both Focus and
Quality every single day. I began to wonder what I would be like if I could
Focus like they did, never created another bug again and was building the right
solutions in the right way.

This series made me realize that I want to be like these amazing developers I
admire. Reading the many skills and attributes embodied by these legendary
individuals helped me understand where I fall short and need to improve. I
don't know if I have what it takes to be at their level, but I want to try
and get there. With my two goals this year, Focus and Quality, I believe I can
dramatically improve and help close the gap.

Focus
===============================================================================

Why improve my ability to focus? I believe if I worked with a higher degree of
focus I would get more done, be more effective and learn faster. Two primary
ways I want to build this habit is to focus on doing fewer activities at a
time and eliminate distractions.

Work in progress is not done and only when we are completely done are our
results valuable for our clients. Building great software requires dedicated
focus and attention which is impossible if you are juggling many different
tasks or projects. Delays between intermediate steps slow down work and
result in getting less done. Conversely, eliminating delays and rework will
increase what I am capable of accomplishing.

Being able to block out the world and focus on one thing is a skill. Like a
muscle, continuously focusing on small tasks which add up to bigger features will
become easier the more your try to do it. Since most development activities
are the sum of many small parts being able to focus and complete each of them
will result in working more effectively.

Improved focus will help me to deliver value to our clients. My definition
for value includes helpings others, sharing knowledge, or merging new code
ready to be shipped. The bigger the positive impact and lower the risk for our
clients the better I am delivering value. Understanding the value being created
and concentrating on activities to maximize that value will lead to better
outcomes.

Doing fewer tasks at a time means I can pour all of my attention into a small
area to completely finish whatever needs to be done. Getting more work done
will result in more improvements for our customers. The added concentration on
the smaller details will help me to understand the risks of changes I am making
and produce better results with fewer defects.

There is another category of work competing my time and energy, distractions.
It is the little things like checking email or attending meetings. Few of these
activities contribute to my work and rarely add value. While working in the
office it can be great to rapidly collaborate with others, but can turn into a
distraction if I am not careful. I believe reducing my distractions will make
it easier to focus on my tasks and get more done.

Another side effect of intense focus is I will be able to learn faster. I have
tried to cultivate a wider range of skills normally peripheral to developing
products. My opportunity with [Exterminators][tribute] allows me to hone my
developer skills with an endless stream of small projects. Focusing on only one
project at a time will let me learn as much as I can from each project then move
on to the next one.

How am I going make the ability to focus a lasting habit?

**By doing fewer things at a time**

* Understand and reduce my work in progress
* Before July first read and apply the book [Getting Things Done][gtd]
* Complete small tasks immediately not as an interruption
* Break up larger tasks into small tasks that provide value
* Do one project at a time

**Eliminating distractions**

* Less time performing status updates (email, task tracking, etc.)
* Less checking email and no email alerts
* Fewer meetings and more collaborative sessions
* At least one Work From Home day weekly

Do fewer things at a time. Do each thing amazingly. Learn. Repeat.

Quality
===============================================================================

Why improve the quality of my work? Do you like defects? I don't. I like it when
programs I am using work as designed. Every time programs behave badly I stop
trusting them. I want to build products users love and trust, are simple to
support and can easily grow over time.

Our team has decided to have zero defects. We will
immediately decide whether a new issue will be fixed or not. If we
(the team and our clients) think a fix is required then we will fix it right away.
Otherwise the issue will be left as is and we can continue focusing on more
valuable features.

Prior to starting this we had a backlog of defects. This surprised me because I
thought we were doing a great job and had excellent quality. Talking about our
defects and problems encountered has made me realize I was wrong.

Looking more closely, we had many areas that were difficult for our clients or
caused them more work. There were some issues we didn't think were a big deal,
but meant a lot to them. We were missing opportunities to work better with our
clients and improve the entire system.

Fewer defects and the trust gained from working together more effectively would
allow us to iterate faster and build the most optimal solution with less effort. Having less
defects would mean spending less time revisiting old solutions and focusing
on new improvements. We had tried to move too quickly before resulting in
defects which has ultimately slowed us down with the extra maintenance.

I want to help our team goal by producing fewer defects. I was directly
responsible for defects and need to be part of the solution. Not understanding
the risks involved with changes I made or assuming our test suite would protect
me has led to defects. Every change presents a risk and making sure they are
mitigated will help me build better products. Improving our test coverage
and knowing more about the system will improve the quality of my work.

To make quality an intrinsic part of how I work I have decided to use the
following practices/guidelines:

* Include high quality automated tests with all new development
* Increase automated testing for existing solutions
* More in-depth validation prior to pushing code
* Favour quality and understanding over speed
* More analysis of proposed work to identify how to ship smaller pieces
* Better collaboration with Testers and Product Owners throughout development/testing

Fewer defects. Lower Risk. Better Products.

Number Three
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is no number three. I was asked whether I was going to include another
goal several times and felt anything else would detract for the original two.
Anything else would ruin my focus and cause me to fail at my first goal.

These goals complement and balance each other well. If I try to focus solely on
productivity my quality will suffer and if I am spending all my time on minute
details I will not be getting enough done. On the other hand, improved focus
will improve the quality of my work. What quality means to our clients and
their risks can prioritize my work show what needs to be focused on.

Making Myself Accountable
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The trick with both my goals is following through. There is no secret formula.
What happens now is I need to live out these new habits. I want to be part of
the minority who achieve their goals, unlike [New Year's resolutions][stats].

I need help to keep these habits. The entire reasons I decided to write them up
and publicly share them was to keep me accountable. For as long as I keep these
goals the fact I declared I what I want to achieve will help me maintain them.
I don't want to let you or myself down and so the only thing I can do is keep
up these habits.

There is another way you can help me with my goals, asking me how they are
doing or telling me about your own goals. Talking about my goals reinforces why
I am trying to do them. Anything that helps me think about my goals will help
reinforce the habits and ensure they are here to stay. I tend to be inspired
by passionate people and if you are excited about what you are doing I would
love to talk about it.

Please, keep me accountable to sticking with my habits. I hope you have goals
of your own and are able to follow through. I challenge you to tell others your
goals and use them to keep you accountable. Good luck.

*I would like to thank my lovely wife [Angela][ange] for her help turning my
collection of reflections into a cohesive blog post and helping me become a
better writer. This week I learnt that paragraphs of [topic sentences][topic]
don't tell you anything at all. Just don't do it.*

<hr />

<a id="ext2-note-1" href="#ext2-note-1-reverse">1.</a> I wanted my posts from
  my time as an Exterminator to be a weekly series. I have fallen behind
  writing and publishing them from the original schedule I wanted. Life happens.

  In spending more time on this post I have been able to spend more time
  reflecting on my goals, putting them into action and understanding what I am
  learning. Being intentional about what I am learning while on Exterminators
  and reflecting on it has been valuable for me. The blog posts are taking
  longer than I would like, but I think are better as a result and I learn more
  from the writing process.

  Thank you for your patience as I continue working through this pseudo-series.
  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
