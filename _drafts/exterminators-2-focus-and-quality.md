A highlight of my second week as an [Exterminator][tribute]<sup id="ext2-note-1-reverse"><a href="#ext2-note-1">1</a></sup> was thinking about
my career goals for this year. I decided on two habits I want
to establish that would improve my abilities the most, the ability to
**[focus](#focus)** and attention to **[quality](#quality)**.

This is an annual activity and this time around I tried to approach it
differently. While my usual goals are fun and challenging, they don't go deep.
Instead of thinking up a laundry list of things to learn or do, I wanted to
build lasting habits that fundamentally change how I work. Throughout the
process I tried to concentrate on why I wanted to improve and why these
specific areas.

In order to stay accountable I decided to share the goals I set for myself.

Inspiration Behind My Goals
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last year I started reading [Dan Blumenthal's][dan] blog and found it to be a
treasure trove for career advice. Dan has a very insightful series on [mastery][mastery],
which has inspired me to become better at my job. Here are the links to the
series. Go read it. I'll wait.

1. [How "Senior" Software Engineers are Different][different]
2. [Anti-Mastery][anti-mastery] (a.k.a guaranteed ways to not be awesome)
3. [Mastering the Basics][basics]
4. [Intermediate Mastery][intermediate]
5. [Mastery][mastery]

Welcome back!

This series outlines many fundamental elements of being a developer. Many
of these elements require lots of time and practice to learn. Others are habits or how you
approach your work. Dan's final post shares insights into what might be required
to become a truly epic developer.

The ability to focus shows up on the [Mastery][mastery] list, and aspects of
quality (or lack thereof) are on the [Anti-Mastery][anti-mastery] list. After
watching other developers I respect, I realized that they ooze both focus and
quality every single day. I began to wonder what I could be capable of if I
focused like they did and if I never created another bug again.

This series made me aspire to be one of those amazing developers.
Reading about the many skills and attributes these legendary
individuals possess helped me understand where I fall short and need to improve. I
don't know if I have what it takes to be at their level, but I want to try
and get there. With my two goals this year, focus and quality, I believe I can
dramatically improve and help close the gap.

Focus
===============================================================================

Why do I want to improve my ability to focus? I believe if I worked with a higher degree of
focus I would get more done, be more effective and learn faster. Two primary
ways I want to build this habit is to focus on doing fewer activities at a
time and eliminate distractions.

Work in progress is not done, and only when we are completely done are our
results valuable for our clients. Building great software requires dedicated
focus and attention, which is impossible if you are juggling many different
tasks or projects. Delays between intermediate steps slow down work and
result in getting less done. Conversely, eliminating delays and rework will
increase what I am capable of accomplishing.

Being able to block out the world and focus on one thing is a skill.
Continuously focusing on small tasks which add up to bigger features will
become easier the more your try to do it. Since most development activities
are the sum of many small parts, being able to focus and complete each part
will result in working more effectively.

Improved focus will help me to deliver value to our clients. My definition
for value includes helping others, sharing knowledge, or merging new code
ready to be shipped. The bigger the positive impact and lower the risk for our
clients, the better I am delivering value. Understanding the value being created,
and concentrating on activities to maximize that value, will lead to better
outcomes.

Doing fewer tasks at a time means I can pour all of my attention into a small
area. The added concentration on small details will help me to understand the
risks of changes I am making and produce better results with fewer defects.

There is another category of work competing for my time and energy: distractions.
It is the little things like checking email or attending meetings. Few of these
activities contribute to my work and rarely add value. While working in the
office it can be great to rapidly collaborate with others, but can turn into a
distraction if I am not careful. I believe reducing my distractions will make
it easier to focus on my tasks and get more done.

Another benefit of intense focus is that I will be able to learn faster. I have
tried to cultivate a wider range of skills normally peripheral to developing
products. My opportunity with [Exterminators][tribute] allows me to hone my
developer skills with an endless stream of small projects. Focusing on only one
project at a time will let me learn as much as I can from each project before moving
on to the next one.

How am I going make the ability to focus a lasting habit?

**By doing fewer things at a time**

* Understanding and reducing my work in progress
* Before July 1<sup>st</sup>, reading and applying the book [Getting Things Done][gtd]
* Completing small tasks immediately, not as an interruption
* Breaking up larger tasks into smaller tasks that provide value
* Doing one project at a time

**Eliminating distractions**

* Spending less time performing status updates (email, task tracking, etc.)
* Checking email less often and disabling email alerts
* Attending fewer meetings and favouring collaborative sessions
* Working from home at least one day a week

Do fewer things at a time. Do each thing amazingly. Learn. Repeat.

Quality
===============================================================================

Why do I want to improve the quality of my work? Do you like defects? I don't. I like it when
programs I am using work as designed. Every time programs behave badly I stop
trusting them. I want to build products that users love and trust, are simple to
support and can easily grow over time.

Our team has resolved to have zero defects. We will
decide whether a new issue will be fixed immediately or not fixed at all. If we
(the team and our clients) think a fix is required, we will fix it right away.
Otherwise the issue will be left as is and we can continue focusing on more
valuable features.

Prior to starting our zero-defect policy, we had a backlog of defects. This surprised me because I
thought we were doing a great job and had excellent quality. Talking about our
defects and problems encountered by our clients has made me realize I was wrong.

Looking more closely, we had many aspects of our product that were difficult for our clients to adopt or
caused them to do more work. There were some issues that I didn't think were a big deal,
but meant a lot to them. By ignoring those issues, we were missing opportunities to work better with our
clients and improve the entire system. We had tried to move too quickly and had
caused defects. Ultimately, the defects slowed us down with extra maintenance.

Fewer defects, along with the trust gained from working together more effectively, would
allow us to iterate faster and build the most optimal solution with less effort. Having less
defects would mean spending more time on new features instead of revisiting old problems.

I want to help our team's goal by personally producing fewer defects. I was directly
responsible for defects and need to be part of the solution. Not understanding
the risks involved with changes I made, or assuming our test suite would protect
me, led to defects. Every change presents a risk, and making sure those risks are
mitigated will help me build better products. Improving our test coverage
and knowing more about the system will improve the quality of my work.

To make quality an intrinsic part of how I work, I have decided to adopt the
following practices/guidelines:

* Include high-quality automated tests with all new development
* Increase automated testing for existing solutions
* More in-depth validation prior to pushing code
* Favour quality and understanding over speed
* More analysis of proposed work to identify how to ship smaller pieces
* Better collaboration with Testers and Product Owners throughout development/testing

Fewer defects. Lower Risk. Better Products.

Number Three
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is no number three. I was asked several times whether I was going to include another
goal, but I felt that anything else would detract from the original two. Having
more goals would contradict my first goal and cause me to fail. Start small.

These goals complement and balance each other well. If I try to focus solely on
productivity my quality will suffer, and if I am spending all my time on minute
details I will not be getting enough done. On the other hand, improved focus
will improve the quality of my work. I want to focus on what our clients value.

Making Myself Accountable
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

</figure>

The trick with both my goals is following through. There is no secret formula.
The next step is to live out these new habits. I want to be part of
the minority who achieve their goals, unlike [New Year's resolutions][stats].

I need help to keep these habits. The entire reason I decided to write them up
and publicly share them was to keep me accountable.
I don't want to let you or myself down, so the only thing I can do is keep
up these habits.

There is another way you can help me with my goals: ask me how they are
coming along or tell me about your own goals. Talking about my goals reinforces why
I am trying to do them. I am inspired by passionate people. If you are excited
about what you are doing I would love to hear about it.

Please keep me accountable with sticking to my habits. I hope you have goals
of your own and are able to follow through. I challenge you to tell others your
goals and use them to keep you accountable. Good luck.

*I would like to thank my lovely wife [Angela][ange] for her help turning my
collection of reflections into a cohesive blog post and helping me become a
better writer. This week I learned that paragraphs of [topic sentences][topic]
don't tell you anything at all. Just don't do it.*

<hr />

<a id="ext2-note-1" href="#ext2-note-1-reverse">1.</a> I intended to post
  weekly during my time as an Exterminator. I have fallen behind in
  writing and publishing them. Life happens.

  In spending more time on this post I have been able to
  reflect further on my goals, begin putting them into action and understand what I am
  learning. Being intentional about what I am learning while on Exterminators
  and reflecting on it has been valuable for me. The blog posts are taking
  longer than I would like, but are better as a result and I'm learning more
  from the writing process.

  Thank you for your patience as I continue working through this pseudo-series.
  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
