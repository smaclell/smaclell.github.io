A highlight of my second week as an [Exterminator][tribute] was thinking about
my career goals for this year. Instead of goals I decided on two habits I want
to establish that would improve my abilities the most, the ability to
**[Focus](#focus)** and attention to **[Quality](#quality)**.

This is an annual activity and this time around I tried to approach it
differently. Instead of thinking up a laundry list to learn or do I decided to
work on habits that will help me become a better developer. Throughout the
process I tried to concentrate on why I wanted to improve and why to improve
these specific areas.

Unlike previous goals to learn a new technology or tackle a new
project I decided to pick habits I wanted to improve. While my usual goals
are fun and challenging they don't go deep. I want to create lasting habits are
and keep them for the whole year. By intentionally trying to live out these new
habits every day I believe I can create a lasting change to how I work.

In order to keep me accountable I decided this is what I would share from this
week as an Exterminator<sup id="ext2-note-1-reverse"><a href="#ext2-note-1">1</a></sup>.

Why Set Annual Goals?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I believe everyone has a unique talent or gift to share with the world.
Developing your skills is a great way to increase what you are capable of
achieving. Whether it is cultivating an expertise or filling a gap there are
always ways to improve yourself.

Improvement is a never-ending journey. For every new thing you learn you can
always learn more and go deeper. You can even change
habits and routines with enough effort. Instead of standing still I think
it is critical to be constantly learning and pushing yourself.

Being a developer right now is exciting with new opportunities and an ever
shifting industry. There
are always new techniques, libraries and projects to learn from. I don't think
you need some innate talent to be a developer, or that programming skills are something you
are born with. If you want to be an amazing developer, you can do it with
enough effort and dedication.

I want to be an amazing developer so I can solve bigger problems and help more people.
I don't have it all together and have much to learn, but I am excited to try.

Fluff -> You are not saying much of anything. No meet yet.
I want to be a better developer

Inspiration Behind My Goals
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last year I started reading [Dan Blumenthal's][dan] blog and found it to be a
treasure trove for career advice. Dan has a very insightful series on [mastery][mastery]
which has inspired me to become better at my job. Here are the links to the
series. Go read it, I'll wait.

1. [How "Senior" Software Engineers are Different][different]
2. [Anti-Mastery][anti-mastery] (a.k.a guaranteed ways to not be awesome)
3. [Mastering the Basics][basics]
4. [Intermediate Mastery][intermediate]
5. [Mastery][mastery]

Welcome back!

This series outlines many important fundamentals to being a developer. Many
take a long amount of exposure and time to learn. Others are habits or how you
go about your work. The final post shows insights into what might be required
to become a truly epic developer.

The ability to Focus shows up on the [Mastery][mastery] list and aspects of
Quality or lack thereof are on the [Anti-Mastery][anti-mastery] list. After
watching other developers I respect I realized that they ooze both Focus and
Quality every single day. I began to wonder what I would be like if I could
Focus like they did, never created another bug again and was building the right
solutions in the right way.

This series made me realize that I want to be like these amazing developers I
admire. Reading the many skills and attributes embodied by these legendary
individuals helped me understand where I fall short and need to improve. I
don't know if I have what it takes to be at their level, but I want to try
and get there. With my two goals this year, Focus and Quality, I believe I can
dramatically improve and help close the gap.

Focus
===============================================================================

Work in progress is not done and only when we are completely done are our
results valuable for our clients. Building great software requires dedicated
focus and attention which is impossible if you are juggling many different
tasks or projects.

Being able to block out the world and focus on one thing is a skill. Like a
muscle, continuously focusing on small tasks which add up to bigger goals will
becomes easier the more your try to do it. This is why I believe it is an
essential habit for software developers to excel.

I want to be able to focus on delivering value for our clients. My definition
for value includes helpings others, sharing knowledge, or merging new code
ready to be shipped. The bigger the positive impact and lower the risk for our
clients the better I am delivering value.

Doing fewer tasks a time means I can pour all of my attention into a small area
to completely finish whatever needs to be done. Getting more done will result
in more improvements for our customers. The added concentration on the smaller
details will help me to understand the risks of changes I am making and produce
better results.

There is another category of work competing my time and energy, distractions.
It is the little things like checking email or attending meetings. Few of these
activities contribute to my work and rarely add value. While working in the
office it can be great to rapidly collaborate with others, but can turn into a
distraction if I am not careful. I believe reducing my distractions will make
it easier to focus on my tasks and get more done.

Another side effect of intense focus is I will be able to learn faster. I have
tried to cultivate a wider range of skills normally peripheral to developing
products. My opportunity with [Exterminators][tribute] allows me to hone my
developer skills with an endless stream of small projects. Focusing on only one
project at a time will let me learn as much as I can from each project then move
on to the next one.

How am I going make the ability to focus a lasting habit?

**By doing fewer things**

* Understand and reduce my work in progress
* Before July first read and apply the book [Getting Things Done][gtd]
* Complete small tasks immediately not as an interruption
* Break up larger tasks into small tasks that provide value
* Do one project at a time

**Eliminating distractions**

* Less time performing status updates (email, task tracking, etc.)
* Less checking email and no email alerts
* Fewer meetings and more collaborative sessions
* At least one Work From Home day weekly

Do fewer things at a time. Do each thing amazingly. Learn. Repeat.

Quality
===============================================================================

Do you like defects? I don't. I like it when programs I am using work every
time.

Customers deserve software that behaves as intended and is free of major
defects. I want to build products users love and trust, are simple to support and
can easily grow over time. Build the right products and build them right.

Shortcuts can add up and begin to bog down projects. Just like in life if you
eat too much junk food you won't be very healthy. Code needs a good diet of
tests, refactoring and maintenance. Even the smallest change can be risky
and if a code base has been left to fend for itself the risks are even greater.

It can be impossible to know exactly what people need before trying to build a
solution to solve their problem. I believe the best solutions are emergent and
the product of iterating repeatedly with guidance from stakeholders.

This is where my view of quality comes from. Balancing the pace of innovation
with the risk of introducing regressions while aspiring to technical excellence.

With one of our recent projects we decided to have zero defects. We would
decide whether a new issue coming in was to be fixed or not immediately. If we
(us and our clients) thought it was important we would fix it right away.
Otherwise the issue would be left alone and we would continue onto more
important work.

Prior to starting this we had a backlog of defects. This surprised me because I
thought we were doing such a great job and our quality was excellent. Talking
about the actual number of defects and problems encountered has made me realize
I was wrong.

Looking more closely we had many areas that were difficult for our clients or
caused them more work. There were some issues we didn't think were a big deal
that meant a lot to them. We were missing opportunities to work better with our
clients and improve the entire system.

Fewer defects and the trust gained from working together more effectively would
allow us to iterate faster and build the most optimal with less effort. Less
defects would mean spending less time now revisiting old solutions and focusing
on new improvements. We had tried to move too quickly before and created
defects as a result which has ultimately slowed us down with the extra maintenance.

Starting to burn down our defects has caused me to think about how I can
prevent defects from being introduced and lower the risk of any change I make.
I think we can have fewer defects and create safer systems. In order to achieve
this I thought up the following practices I could do to improve the quality of
the code I write:

* Include high quality automated tests with all new development
* Increase automated testing for existing solutions
* More in-depth validation prior to pushing code
* Favour quality and understanding over speed
* More analysis of proposed work to identify how to ship smaller pieces
* Better collaboration with Testers and Product Owners throughout development/testing

Number 3?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is no number three. I was asked whether I was going to include another
goal several times and felt anything else would detract for the original two.

These goals complement and balance each other well. If I try to focus solely on
productivity my quality will suffer and if I am spending all my time on minute
details I will not be getting enough done.

Making Myself Accountable
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The trick with both my goals is to follow through. There is no secret formula
and what happens now is I need to live them out. I want to be part of the
minority who achieve their goals, unlike [New Year's resolutions][stats].

I need help to get there. You can help me by asking about how my goals are
doing and telling me about your own. Talking about my goals reinforces why I am
trying to do them. Thinking about them more often helps reinforce the habits
and make sure they are here to stay. I tend to be inspired by passionate people
and if you are excited about what you are doing I would love to talk about it.

Please, keep me accountable to sticking with my habits. What are your goals and
aspirations?

*I would like to thank my lovely wife [Angela][ange] for her help turning my
collection of reflections into a cohesive blog post and helping me become a
better writer. This week I learnt that paragraphs of [topic sentences][topic]
don't tell you anything at all. Just don't do it.*

<hr />

<a id="ext2-note-1" href="#ext2-note-1-reverse">1.</a> I wanted my posts from
  my time as an Exterminator to be a weekly series. I have fallen behind
  writing and publishing them from the original schedule I wanted. Life happens.

  In spending more time on this post I have been able to spend more time
  reflecting on my goals, putting them into action and understanding what I am
  learning. Being intentional about what I am learning while on Exterminators
  and reflecting on it has been valuable for me. The blog posts are taking
  longer than I would like, but I think are better as a result and I learn more
  from the writing process.

  Thank you for your patience as I continue working through this pseudo-series.
  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
