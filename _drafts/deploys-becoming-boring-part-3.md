Deployments are now longer an event. Routine has taken over. Where are we going
next and why. We like this stress free future we have built and can now sit
back to see where we are.

Routine Again
=======================================

Each success built more trust.
Any member of the team can perform the deployment and is downright boring.
Stakeholders who wanted to slow previously now want fixes and features early.

Next
=======================================

Even faster, full continous deployment. Twice as fast to other environments.
