Retrospectives are a great tool to come up with actions the team use to improve.
Team discussions exploring the biggest challenges faced by the team are healthy
and can help teams overcome their obstacles. For improvement to stick I believe
the team needs to choose action items to address their biggest hurdles and
follow through with them.

Team retrospectives are a very common agile practice. Over time they can lose
focus and start to drift into yet another meeting. People show up. Talk. Leave.

I believe great retrospectives are important for making teams more effective.
Unlike just another meeting retrospectives are a chance to take a look at the
past while and reflect on how things are going. From this perfect vantage point
activities, events, actions or interactions that helped our hurt the team are
easier to see.

Mixing together the perspectives of all of the team members hopefully some
consensus team challenges or opportunities can be identified. Hopefully some
great ideas for taking the team to the next level can be suggested. From there
the team can pick a few things they will try to do or change until the next
retrospective. Boom, retrospected.

Lacklustre retrospectives have lacklustre outcomes. Sometimes teams try to take
on everything they could possibly change all at once. The discussion becomes the
entire meeting and no action items are chosen. Maybe the team is not comfortable
which cause the discussion and action items to be superficial.

This week we had a retrospective that did not sit well with me. We talked in
circles, but did not come to a final resolution or action for the team. Sadly,
the strongest personalities dominated the discussion and we missed out on other
valuable opinions from others on the team. I was there. I participated in the
process, but was left wanting more.

In this retrospective I felt we were missing two key ingredients to go from
being okay to being AWESOME. We needed to have a healthy discussion about our
challenges and decide on clear action items to address them.

Healthy Discussion
===============================================================================

Conversations can get messy. People can get heated. You can get off track.
There can be a million things to talk about and getting to one the whole team
can agree on is a hard problem. If it was easy you wouldn't be having the
retrospective and would also be a bazillionaire.

So what are we talking about here? Oh right, healthy group discussions. In a
retrospective if you goal is to walk away with action items to address the most
burning need your team a few pointers to keep in mind.

You want a well rounded conversation engaging the entire team. Not blaming each
other for problems. No egos crowding the room. Understanding the problems and
opportunities the team has available. Reflecting on the past work to create
better results in the future.

The failure or success blame games do not belong in healthy retros. They erode
teams and only lead to hurting one another. Venting about problems might make
you feel better momentarily but will not solve them.

Mistakes happen. Try to dig deeper and understand what issues led to the
problems that were caused. Keep in mind the retrospective prime
directive which if followed makes blame irrelevant:

> Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone
> did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills
> and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.
>
> -- Norm Kerth

Power dynamics with teams and egos crush discussions. Less confident team
members with great ideas will go unheard if over powered by others on the
team. If a flashy developer wants to prove how amazing it can change the retro
from being about the team to being about them.

It is important to hear opinions from the entire team to avoid any one person
monopolizing the conversation. The facilitator, meeting format and participants
can prevent this from happening. Together you can make retros a safe place
where everyone can be heard and work toward the best interested of the team.

Retrospectives tend to diverge then converge. There can be lots to cover and
exploring ideas and what the team is interested in often involves brainstorming
or [activities][fun]. Coming to a large consensus about what actions to take
can use more activities, clustering or discussion.

Depending on the approach used for either activities there can be varying
degrees of success for different teams. Typical retrospective games can
completely turn off some teams. Others which not feel comfortable voting and
discussing their challenges. Find something that works for your team and
periodically mix it up. Try to tailor the activity to the personalities and
strengths of the team.

The final goal for the retrospective is to converge on action items to improve
the team. Make sure enough time is allocated to come up with ideas and topics.
Focus on facilitating the conversation and ensuring the team converges on at
least one viable action item.

Action Items
===============================================================================

The conversation in the retrospective is not enough to change the team. You
need to do work or make some alterations. I would be very surprised if after a
great retrospective you didn't come away energized with actions you want do to
improve the team immediately.

Before I get carried away what do I mean by an "action"? This could be anything
you actively want to do, experiment with, build or alter a behaviour. Try using
a new tool. Experiment with pair programming. Treat code reviews as more urgent
than any other work.

Ideas:

Team retrospectives are one of my favourite meetings. They are a fantastic time
to discuss how team is feeling and how to be more awesome. During the retro
the entire team can take a step back, away from the hussle and bussle of day to
day work they can turn their focus inward. I think it is important to come away
with specific actions or changes the team wants to do and focus on them. What
is chosen by the team does not matter, the important part is the team chooses
together what they feel is the most important area to improve.

I think learning and improving is crucial. Improving as a team is harder, but
worth it in the long run. .
yourself is very important.


What are you trying to say here? It was a long time ago now.

Talked in circles.
Rapid branches was the discussion.



Retros are important.
Balanced Discussion - Voices are heard and people contribute
Actions - not venting and not just discussion
