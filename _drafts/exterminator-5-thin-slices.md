Shipping small slices. Want to increasely add value, but don't want to introduce risk.

Minimize the impact to existing code.
Reduce the risk. Safe changes.
Don't do very much.
Repeat.

Sketch up what you want to do. Cut it up. Do it.

Legacy code? Add your tests first!
Prototype it. Then throw it away.
Do your code beside the old code. Cut Over.
Test the snot out of what you are doing.
Separate refactoring.
Separate any setup steps.
Separate any clean up.
More testing when you cut in pieces.
The more the merrier!
