I have been running an experiment. Instead of having massive pull requests to
completely finish large chunks of work what if I broke it up into many MANY
little pieces. At the same time I have been trying to keep each piece shippable
and add up to the eventual story I am working on.

Shipping small slices. Want to increasely add value, but don't want to introduce risk.

Minimize the impact to existing code.
Reduce the risk. Safe changes.
Don't do very much.
Repeat.

Sketch up what you want to do. Cut it up. Do it.

Legacy code? Add your tests first!
Prototype it. Then throw it away.
Do your code beside the old code. Cut Over.
Test the snot out of what you are doing.
Separate refactoring.
Separate any setup steps.
Separate any clean up.
More testing when you cut in pieces.
The more the merrier!
