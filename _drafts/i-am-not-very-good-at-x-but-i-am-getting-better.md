There are many things I don't think I am particularly good at and that is okay.
No one is the best at everything and I think attitude is everything. I am
becoming more and more of an optimist, which leads me to believe that even if I
am not very good at something I can always get better if I want.

Phrases like "I am no good at X" tend to hold people back. They will either see
it like an obstacle preventing them from ever doing X or another challenge to
overcome. Improving at things takes practice and dedication, but you don't have
to stay where you are right now.

I just read [How To Just Ship: An Interview With Amy Hoy][ship] from the Trello
blog and found it very refreshing. I talks a little about fixed vs. growth
mindset. This is something I am not an expert in, but I aspire to have a
positive outlook and aways be focused on growth opportunities.

If you approach "I am no good at X" as a permanent barrier because you just
can't do it or don't understand it then you are missing out. The flip-side of
the coin is that you can do it and you will figure it eventually out if you
try.

I don't think I am a good writer. It is something that does not come naturally
to me and I think that is okay. Working on this blog is something I want to do
and if that means practicing writing more, getting help from [others][swart],
or taking more time to get it right then that is what I will do.

Just because you are not very good at something right not does not mean you
will always be that way.

What is it you always wanted to be better at doing? A new skill you wanted to
learn? Stick with it. You will be happy you did.
