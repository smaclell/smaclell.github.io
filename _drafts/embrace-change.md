In January I had the worst month of my life. My wife and I joked we wanted to
redo 2016. Within a single week I lost my job and we had a death in the family.
In this post I want to tell you about this traumatic experience and how this
massive change has turned out positive.

In The Beginning ...
===============================================================================

I started this year with all the optimism in the world. Throughout the holidays
leading up to 2016, I tried to refocus myself on being more positive and working
really hard on doing a great a job.

This was a stark contrast to the previous several months. The past year at work
was a little rocky with many ups and downs. I had been feeling little I needed
a change and wanted to continue growing. My time with the
[Exterminators][exterminators] was a blast. The experience showed me new areas
I could learn and improve. In many ways it made me excited about software
development again.

Returning to my previous team was a jarring. Our project was becoming more
stable and I still wanted to work on bigger projects. My heart was not entirely
in the work. Focus and quality suffered.

In the months leading up to January I was contemplating a larger change. The
essential question was whether I could still have an impact in my current
job/company. Getting things done could become frustrating and I did not deal
with this well. Over time my morale eroded further as I started to consider
greener pastures else where.

During a large company developer conference and the holidays I started to see
life differently. I fully believe in [D2L][d2l]'s. I worked with phenomenal
people like Craig and Daryl who I could still learn more from. Where maybe in
my current role I had hit a plateau, the company as a whole still has many
great things to offer. They operate on a much larger scale and have different
challenges which could be exciting.

In January I hit the ground running. I was excited again. Each task I worked on
received my complete attention. Coming to work each day was fantastic. We had
great projects lined up and we were making a difference.

Terminus
===============================================================================

The company mentioned there might be some changes come later in the month. In
the past our team had been completely immune. After all our team was doing
critical which could dramatically improve how the company operates. I
considered myself an important contributing member of team team and in my
hubris didn't think anything of it.

On that fateful January 26th, my manager who seemed a little choked up came and
got me at my desk. This was not like him. I felt a pang of fear. My time at D2L
was finished. I was given a set of paper work, told the terms and then escorted
to a conveniently located door nearby.

I was absolutely stunned. It was difficult to speak. On my way out I bumped
into one of my mentors and could barely tell them what happened. It took
everything to stop myself from crying.

We had planned our life out around my job. This was one thing I thought I could
depend on. I had worked there for over 5.5 years. In the previous few years we
bought a house and had our son, Jude. Even in our wildest contingencies we were
not ready for me to lose my job. The news was overwhelming.

Then the second bombshell went off. My wife was expecting our second child. She
had started to have signs things were not right. 2 days after I was let go we
lost the child. Even now months later I immediately brought back to the
devastation we felt. All we could do was hold each other and cry. As I write
this I am crying again as the memories come flooding back.

Doubt
===============================================================================

This was the worst week of my life.

I spent too much of the next few months rethinking everything. Was there
something I did? Something I didn't do? Why was I chosen? Not knowing why was
perhaps the hardest part.

Even now I doubt myself. Had I just been a [phony][phony] all these years? Am I
even a decent programmer? Or am I something much
worst. There is a really interesting cognitive bias known as the [Dunning-Kruger][dk]
effect where the truly incompetent cannot possibly know how bad they are. They
lack the meta-thinking to understand their own faults. In short, you can be so
bad you don't realize it.

I talked a little bit about my self doubts in my post
'[Are you your code review?][review]'. This event fanned the flames of those
doubts even more. Leading up to the exit interview I thought of a page worth
of things which I thought might have added me to this list of people.

You are your own worst enemy. Talking to my former boss helped clear up almost
everything on my list. He helped me realize areas for improvement and that I
was not a horrible failure.

Getting past my self-doubt and focusing on moving forward was the first step.
This easily becomes a dark line of thinking which only leads to self-destruction.

Acceptance
===============================================================================

Our family took the first week to recover back to normal. There was no changing
what had happened. Life happened. What was our routine had changed forever. We
needed to accept this new reality and move forward.

We did a few things the first week, but otherwise took our time to accept what
had just happened. I was able to better accept what had happened and move on.

In the end I felt it was better that I was chosen instead of someone else. Me
staying probably would have meant someone else leaving. After our life had
normalized a bit, I was optimistic we would be okay.

Although being asked to leave was not great, it did open the door for new
growth. At several points while at D2L I had felt like leaving. I was never
able to make the choice on my own and now the choice was made for me.

On The Hunt
===============================================================================

Getting a job has a fairly straight forward process:

* Write resume and cover letters
* Find jobs
* Apply
* Interviews
* Repeat or accept the offer

This time around I learned how invaluable your connections are. Over time I had
worked with many different people who were now at all kinds of different
companies. I great role models at D2L who were willing to be references.

Thanks to my [network][linkedin], finding potential jobs changed dramatically.
The first step now was to talk to my connections. Right away I was introduced
to potential companies. I went for coffee to learn about open positions. Casual
meetings turned into interviews.

Finding potential jobs in Kitchener-Waterloo is also extremely easy thanks to
services through Communitech. They run an active [job board][tech-jobs] which
has hundreds of fantastics postings available. I found many interesting
postings there.

Resumes and cover letters are a must. Within the first week I had mine updated
and was ready to share it with the world. It slowly got better over time as I
got more and more feedback. Luckily had updated it sporadically with different
achievements and milestones.

Interviews are intimidating. It had been over 5 years since I last
interviewed at all. Co-op terms at university gave me a lot of practice, but
without using those skills I found I was very rusty.  I definitely bombed a
few of them. My friends helped me through mock interviews to refresh my memory.

Regardless of how they went I always sent a follow up email to reflect on what
went well and thank the interviews for their time. If possible I would address
specific hicups and highlight what I bring to the table. After coming home I
would implement the programming questions I was given to make sure my solutions
worked as expected.

Due to my background I am less good at algorithms and some standard interview
questions. I spent alot of time practicing interview problems and reading up on
[algorithms][algorithms]. When that wasn't enough I tried learning Ruby and new
Javascript frameworks/idioms.

Success
===============================================================================

Things started slowly then picked up pace. At first I just had coffee with
former colleagues/mentors. Then interviews started to trickle in. As things
warmed up I needed to get much better at planning my time. During the last week
I had a flurry of final interviews and then needed to make a choice.

In the final stages I was fortunate to have several great companies and offers.
Each presented different opportunities and challenges. I don't think I could
have went wrong choosing any of the options. There were a few where I was not
successful with and I will need to try again another time.

After the flurry of interviews I took the weekend and made my decision. Due to
the timing I had an extra week off. HR at the new company was extremely
supportive and helped me through all the paper work.

On March 7<sup>th</sup> I started working at [Vidyard][vidyard] full time!
From the first day I was blown away by the amazing the culture. They were
so welcoming and helped me get connected right away. On my second day I pushed
code to production!

Conclusion
===============================================================================

I learned from this experience.

* Accept it and move on
* You are not your job. It should not be your #1 priority and you need to be less dependant on it.
* Interviewing and job searching is a skill. Keep practicing.
* This was the jump start I needed to make a change. I was due for a change. I wish I had done it years ago.

Epilogue
===============================================================================

Why write this post now? I am finishing my probation and feeling more
comfortable at Vidyard. After the event I was so shaken up I decided to put the
blog on hold. Starting a new job I wanted to make sure my first 90 days were
solid.

Well, mostly solid. I was sick for a full 3 weeks. In the first month I worked
from a bed at home more than I did in the office. Although I was sweating
bullets while coughing up lung chunks my manager was extremely supportive. My
coworkers all told me not to worry and later I could look back and laugh
about it. I had their trust to do what I needed to do and the space to get
better. The entire experience was yet another testament to why Vidyard is
awesome.

Now I have shipped a few features and am working on something bigger. It has
been a blast. I feel like I have learnt so much in a very little time.
Hopefully, in the coming weeks I will be able to share what I have learned
with you.
