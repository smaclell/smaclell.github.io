In January I had the worst week of my life. My wife and I joked we wanted to
start 2016 in February. Within a single week I lost my job and we had a miscarriage.
In this post I want to tell you about this traumatic experience, how this
massive change has turned out positive and what I learned from it.

Before
===============================================================================

I started this year with all the optimism in the world. Throughout the holidays
leading up to 2016, I tried to refocus myself. The year started with new
habits and influences which improved my outlook on life. I was determined to be
more positive and work hard at doing a great job.

This was a stark contrast to the previous several months which were filled with ups and downs.

My time with the [Exterminators][exterminators] was a blast. I felt re-energized
and excited about software development again. While with the team I found new
growth areas and doubled down on existing skills. This left me wanting more.

Q: Which is better?

A:

Returning to my previous team was jarring. Our project was becoming routine
work and I felt like I wanted to go a different direction. In order to continue
learning I thought I needed bigger and bigger projects. My heart was not entirely
in the work. [Focus and quality][fq] suffered.

B:

Returning to my previous team was jarring. When I left I was excited about a
new project which would have a huge impact. Incorrectly, I thought I would
get to dive into it right away. After I had started prototyping portions of it,
the whole project was given to another team.

Instead, I was relegated to ongoing
maintenance on a different project. My learning slowed. Shortly afterwards our team split in two.
Another project I was excited about went with the other half of the team. I
felt like I had been punted to the B team. My heart was not
in my work. [Focus and quality][fq] suffered.

:Q

In the months leading up to January I was contemplating a larger change. The
essential question was whether I could still have an impact in my job or company.
Getting things done was frustrating and I did not deal
with this well. Over time my morale eroded further as I considered
greener pastures else where.

However, during a company wide developer conference and the holidays I started to see
life differently. In my role
I might have plateaued, but I realized [D2L][d2l] as a whole still has many
great things to offer. I worked with phenomenal
people like Craig and [Daryl][daryl] who I could still learn from. They operate on a large scale and have different
challenges which are exciting. Lastly, I fully believe in D2L's [mission][d2l-mission] of transforming learning.

In January I hit the ground running. I reset my perspective. I was excited again. Each task I worked on
received my complete attention. I was crushing it again. Coming to work each day was fantastic. We had
great projects lined up and we were making a difference.

Terminus
===============================================================================

The company mentioned there might be some changes come later in the month. In
the past our team had been completely immune. After all, our team was doing
critical work which could dramatically improve how the company operates. I
considered myself an important contributing member of team and in my
hubris didn't think anything of it.

On that fateful January 26th, my manager who seemed a little choked up came and
got me at my desk. This was not like him. I felt a pang of fear, then it happened. My time at D2L
was finished. I was given the paper work, told the terms and then escorted
to a conveniently located exit nearby.

I was absolutely stunned. It was difficult to speak. On my way out I bumped
into one of my mentors and could barely tell them what happened. It took
everything to stop myself from crying.

We had planned our life out around my job. This was one thing I thought I could
depend on. I had worked there for over 5.5 years. In the previous few years we
bought a house and had our son, Jude. How were we going to afford everything?
Even in our wildest contingencies we were
not ready for me to lose my job. The news was overwhelming.

Then the second bombshell went off. My wife was expecting our second child. She
was having signs things were not right. The day after I was let go we
lost the baby. Even months later, I am immediately brought back to the
devastation we felt. All we could do was hold each other and cry. As I write
this I am crying again as the memories come flooding back.

This was the worst week of my life.

Doubt
===============================================================================

You are your own worst enemy. I spent too much of the next few months rethinking everything. Was there
something I did? Something I didn't do? Why was I chosen? Not knowing why is
perhaps the hardest part.

Even now I doubt myself. Have I been a [phony][phony] for all these years? Am I
a horrible programmer or worst? There is a interesting cognitive bias known as the [Dunning-Kruger][dk]
effect where the truly incompetent cannot possibly know how bad they are. They
lack the meta-thinking to understand their own faults. In short, you can be so
bad you don't realize it. Is that me?

I talked a little bit about my self doubts in my post
'[Are you your code review?][review]'. They have always been with me. This event fanned the flames of those
doubts even more.

Leading up to the exit interview I wrote lists
of things which I thought might have led to this outcome.
Talking to my former boss helped clear up my
lists. He highlighted areas for improvement and made me feel like I
was not a failure.

Getting past my self-doubt and focusing on moving forward was the first step.
This easily becomes a dark line of thinking which only leads to self-destruction.

Acceptance
===============================================================================

Our family took the first week to recover and get back to normal. There was no changing
what had happened. Daily life was permanently altered. We needed to accept this new reality and move forward.

</figure>

During those first few days the wierdest thing I needed to accept was my
coworkers were suddenly not there. Waking up every morning I was confronted
with the fact I would not be seeing Travis and Josh today. Many of my
coworkers had grown into close friends who I rely on a great deal. I was always
happy to see them again or beat them at foozball. Our relationship would need
to change if it was to survive.

Another odd thought experiment I needed to accept was the other choices D2L
could have made. Was I chosen instead of other people? Would me
staying mean someone else leaving. In the end I felt it was
better that I was chosen instead
of someone else. Better I go through this than one of my friends. After our life
had normalized a bit, I was optimistic we would be okay and didn't want them to
have the same burden.

Although being asked to leave was not great, it did open the door for new
opportunities. With our last several projects I had been dipping my toes into
different technologies and was really enjoying it. Now I had the chance to make
a bigger shift in my career.

Searching
===============================================================================

Getting a job in the past was a fairly straight forward process:

* Write a resume
* Find jobs
* Write cover letters
* Apply
* Interview
* Repeat or accept the offer

This time around everything happened at the same time and looked like:

* Network, find jobs and apply all at once
* Interview
* Review and accept offers

During this job hunt I learned how invaluable your connections are in finding new jobs. Over the years I had
worked with many different people who had moved on from D2L to other companies.
I had great role models at D2L who were willing to be references.

Thanks to my [network][linkedin], finding potential jobs changed dramatically.
The first step in my search was to talk to my connections. Right away I was introduced
to potential companies. I went for coffee to learn about open positions. Casual
meetings turned into interviews. Suddenly leaving a company does wonders for your
LinkedIn profile:

</figure>

Finding potential jobs in Kitchener-Waterloo is also extremely easy thanks to
services through Communitech. They run an active [job board][tech-jobs] which
has hundreds of fantastics postings available. I found many interesting
companies with a diverse range of sizes and needs.

A number of recruiters reached out with various opportunities. While I did
not use their services, they showed me positions typically outside of my
existing network. They helped restore my confidence that I would be able to find
a new job and move past my doubts.

Resumes and cover letters are a must. Within the first week I had mine updated
and was ready to share it with the world. It slowly got better over time with
more and more feedback. Luckily, I had updated it sporadically with different
achievements and milestones.

Interviews are intimidating. It had been over 5 years since I last
interviewed at all. Co-op terms at university gave me a lot of practice, but
without using those skills for years I found I was very rusty. My friends
helped me through mock interviews to get me ready. Even still, I bombed a
few of them which was tough.

Regardless of how an interview went I always sent a follow up email to:

* Thank the interviewer
* Emphasize what went well
* Address any hiccups
* Reiterate why I would be a great fit

Due to my background I am less good at algorithms and get caught up on some standard interview
questions. I spent alot of time practicing interview problems and reading up on
[algorithms][algorithms]. When that wasn't enough I tried learning Ruby and refreshing
my knowledge of Javascript frameworks/idioms. After coming home from interviews, I implemented
the programming questions I was given to double check my solutions.

Success
===============================================================================

Things started slowly then picked up pace. At first I just had coffee with
former colleagues/mentors. Interviews started to trickle in and then really
accelerated. During the last week I had a flurry of final interviews leading
up to a difficult choice.

In the final stages I was fortunate to have several offers from great companies.
Each presented different opportunities and challenges. I don't think I could
have went wrong choosing from any of the options. Other interviews were not successful
and I will need to try again another time.

Over the weekend I made my decision. Due to
the timing I had another week off to relax and decompress before starting work.
The end was in sight after the harrowing month which preceded it.

On March 7<sup>th</sup> I started working at [Vidyard][vidyard] full time!
Even before the first day I was blown away by the amazing the culture. They were
so welcoming and helped me get connected right away. On my second day I pushed
code to production! I am thrilled to be part of the team.

Lessons
===============================================================================

What may have been the worst week of my life at the time, will now be the start
of a bigger change in my life. This entire experience has taught me so much and
helped me understand what matters most.

At D2L, I poured alot of time, effort and self worth into my job only to see it come to
and end. I was slowly learning work should not be my #1 priority. This
experience brought that realization painfully to forefront.

</figure>

What really matters is our relationships and loved ones. The quiet moments as a family during
the first week will stay with me forever. I cannot thank enough the many friends
and family members who supported us through this challenging period. We are so
fortunate to have them in our lives.

We needed to accept what had happened to move on. Hopefully some day we will
have other children. I found another job. We can learn from our past, but
should not dwell on it.

Interviewing is a skill you need to keep practicing. From now on I plan on
regularly interviewing and updating my resume so I will not become rusty again.
The goal is not to job hop every year. Instead, I want to understand what
people are looking for and be able to confidently present myself.

I was due for a change and believe I have found what I needed. While my time at
D2L was a great learning experience, I was restless and wanted something else.
During several low points while at D2L I had felt like leaving. I was never
able to make the choice on my own and now the choice was made for me.

Epilogue
===============================================================================

Why write this post now? I am finishing my probation and feeling more
comfortable at Vidyard. After the event I was so shaken up I decided to put the
blog on hold. Starting a new job I wanted to make sure my first 3 months were
solid.

Well, mostly solid. Almost immediately after starting I was sick for a full 3
weeks. In the first month I worked
from a bed at home more than I did at the office. Although I was sweating
bullets while coughing up lung chunks, my manager was extremely supportive. My
coworkers all told me not to worry and how later I could look back and laugh
about it. I had their trust to do what I needed to do and the space to get
better. The entire experience was yet another testament to why Vidyard is
awesome.

Now, I have shipped a few features and am working on something bigger. It has
been a blast. I feel like I have learnt so much in very little time.
Hopefully, in the coming weeks I will be able to share what I have learned
with you.
