In January I had the worst month of my life. My wife and I joked we wanted to
redo 2016. Within a single week I lost my job and we had a death in the family.
In this post I want to tell you about this traumatic experience and how this
massive change has turned out positive.

In The Beginning ...
===============================================================================

I started this year with all the optimism in the world. Throughout the holidays
leading up to 2016, I tried to refocus myself on being more postive and working
really hard on doing a great a job.

This was a stark contrast to the previous several months. The past year at work
was a little rocky with many ups and downs. I had been feeling little I needed
a change and wanted to continue growing. My time with the
[Exterminators][exterminators] was a blast. The experience showed me new areas
I could learn and improve. In many ways it made me excited about software
development again.

Returning to my previous team was a jaring. Our project was becoming more
stable and I still wanted to work on bigger projects. My heart was not entirely
in the work. Focus and quality suffered.

In the months leading up to January I was contemplating a larger change. The
essential question was whether I could still have an impact in my current
job/company. Getting things done could become frustrating and I did not deal
with this well. Over time my morale eroded further as I started to consider
greener pastures else where.

During a large company developer conference and the holidays I started to see
life differently. I fully believe in [D2L][d2l]'s. I worked with phenominal
people like Craig and Daryl who I could still learn more from. Where maybe in
my current role I had hit a plateau, the company as a whole still has many
great things to offer. They operate on a much larger scale and have different
challenges which could be exciting.

In January I hit the ground running. I was excited again. Each task I worked on
received my complete attention. Coming to work each day was fantastic. We had
great projects lined up and we were making a difference.

Terminus
===============================================================================

The company mentioned there might be some changes come later in the month. In
the past our team had been completely immune. After all our team was doing
critical which could dramatically improve how the company operates. I
considered myself an important contributing member of team team and in my
hubris didn't think anything of it.

On that fateful January 26th, my manager who seemed a little choked up came and
got me at my desk. This was not like him. I felt a pang of fear. My time at D2L
was finished. I was given a set of paper work, told the terms and then escorted
to a conveniently located door nearby.

I was absolutely stunned. It was difficult to speak. On my way out I bumped
into one of my mentors and could barely tell them what happened. It took
everything to stop myself from crying.

We had planned our life out around my job. This was one thing I thought I could
depend on. I had worked there for over 5.5 years. In the previous few years we
bought a house and had our son, Jude. Even in our wildest contingencies we were
not ready for me to lose my job. The news was overwhelming.

Then the second bombshell went off. My wife was expecting our second child. She
had started to have signs things were not right. 2 days after I was let go we
lost the child. Even now months later I immediately brought back to the
devastation we felt. All we could do was hold each other and cry. As I write
this I am crying again as the memories come flooding back.

Doubt
===============================================================================

This was the worst week of my life.

I spent too much of the next few months rethinking everything. Was there
something I did? Something I didn't do? Why was I chosen? Not knowing why was
perhaps the hardest part.

Even now I doubt myself. Am I even a decent programmer? Or am I something much
worst. There is a really interesting cognitive bias known as the [Dunning-Kruger][dk]
effect where the truly incompetent cannot possibly know how bad they are. They
lack the meta-thinking to understand their own faults.

I talked a little bit about my self doubts in my post '[Are you your code review?][review]'.
They have only been there. Prior to being released I even emailed my boss and
his boss to see what they thought about the project.

TODO: Here.

 psychological effect known as
Had I just been a [phony][phony] all these years?

This became a dark line of thinking which only leads to self-destruction.

Acceptance
===============================================================================

Our family took the first week to recover back to normal. There was no changing
what had happened. Life happened. What was our routine had changed forever. We
needed to accept this new reality and move forward.

We did a few things the first week, but otherwise took our time to accept what
had just happened.

On The Hunt
===============================================================================

* Accept it and move on
* You are not your job. It should not be your #1 priority and you need to be less dependant on it.
* Interviewing and job searching is a skill. Keep practicing.
* This was the jump start I needed to make a change. I was due for a change. I wish I had done it years ago.
