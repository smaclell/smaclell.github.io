I recently attended several fantastic developer talks where I [work][d2l].
My co-worker, Chris, had a very interesting talk about lessons he learnt during
7 months of code reviews with a team from another office. He had some great
insights I have been thinking through. The one which sticks with me is: how your
code reviews are a reflection of you.

Chris had the benefit of helping a remote team get started. It was really hard
and I appreciate the work his team put in. His presentation reviewed what he
learned after months of working with the same people. Code reviews were the
focal point for most of his interactions.

When code reviews become the primary way you interact things change.
You don't know them as a person and
you cannot see them on a daily basis. If they keep giving crappy code reviews
your opinion of them forms quickly. Likewise, consistently great code can help
them stand apart.

This was the reality for Chris while working with the remote team. Being a talk
on code reviews he found special examples highlighting lessons he wanted to
share. He felt after a while the code reviews became the main representation
of a persons' current ability.

This all got me thinking about being evaluated and represented by each of
code review. I thought about how I often become too attached to my code.
Then there were several great blog posts I had read which try to separate your
worth and being from the code you write. In the end I think I found a way I can
bring these conflicting views together.

<strong>Reminder:</strong> My blog is my own opinion and not necessarily that of my employer.
That said thanks for the great sessions!

Invested
===============================================================================

Connecting this with what Chris said, I take feedback to my code reviews to
heart. On the receiving end, I really care about maintaining the quality of
what we built. When I send code reviews I try to be careful in how I approach
making changes and hope I don't look stupid.

The darkside is when I treat the comments I give or receive like an attack.
Reviews need to be an open discussion and not to showcase how brilliant you are.
Instead, humility and listening need to be an important part of each code review.

It is really easy to become invested in your code. I put lots of
effort and care into my work I do. I become emotionally invested. Too often
I am extremely defencive about my code and take feedback too personally.

The feelings of ownership intensify the longer I have been with a project and
what role I had in its formation. This is where I am with my current project.
We have been on it since it began and seen it go through many changes.

Over the last few weeks I was able to wrap up a project I had slowly been working on for 7
months. At the same set of talks, I presented about how this project evolved.
I feel personally responsible for the code. It feels like any feedback on
the project or results reflect on me.

I am self conscious about by ability as a developer. I often feel like an
[imposter][imposter]. Combined putting myself out there in my code reviews
you get a potent mix of feelings and lack of confidence. My inner phony is
on display.

You Are Not Your Code
===============================================================================

There are many great [blog][scott] [posts][jeff] about how [you are not your code][google]. I
need to take this message to heart and separate myself from suggestions and
improvements to code I have created.

TODO: Explain roughly what the posts mean to you. Relate them back to code reviews

The gist of these posts is to separate your self esteem and worth from the code
you create. You are so much more than the code you write for your job or hobby.

Criticism of code you have written is natural and healthy. The important part
is how you learn from the feedback you are given.

How does this work if the way your colleagues think about you is with respect
to your code reviews? This seems like the opposite perspective from
*you are not your code*. If you are not your code then how can your reviews
represent you?

Wrestling through this contradiction caused me to rethink Chris' talk.

Caring Professionally
===============================================================================

I think both ideas can fit together. The sum total of your being is not
the code you write. How you present yourself, learn, care and interact with
others is a clear reflection of what you value.

In talking with Chris, he cares about the humans behind their code reviews. In
teasing apart what he said and reflecting on it I think caring is the most
important part of each review. Not getting emotionally attached to your code,
but putting your best foot forward and caring about your work.

If someone else if going to take the time to review your code be kind to them.
One of the recommendations from the talk was to make sure the best review of
your code was the review you do prior to sending it to someone else. Go through
your changes on your own and clean up any loose ends. Add comments explaining
the decisions you made.

I think constantly improving and trying you best is part of being a professional
programmer. Learning from your code reviews and putting effort into each of them
is important. Try to make the the most of each review and the feedback you
receive.

Be supportive when interactive with others. Don't stomp around and shoot down
their ideas. Treat others how you want to be treated and you cannot go wrong.

Although I don't count myself as a great developer, like [Jeff Atwood][jeff]
I care too much.

The solution is to convert my caring into actions which help the team. Care
about your work and do your best for each code review.
