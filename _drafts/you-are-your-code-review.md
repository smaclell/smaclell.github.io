I recently attended a bunch of fantastic developer talks where I [work][d2l].
My co-worker, Chris, had a very interesting talk about lessons he learnt during
7 months of code reviews with a team from another office. He had some great
insights I have been thinking through. The one which sticks with me is: how your
code reviews are a reflection of you.

Chris had the benefit of helping a remote team get started. It was really hard
and I appreciate the work his team put in. His presentation reviewed what he
learned after months of working with the same people. Code reviews were the
focal point for most of his interactions.

In his talk, Chris took an extreme position. For some people their code reviews
is the primary way you interact with them. You don't know them as a person and
you cannot see them on a daily basis. If they keep giving crappy code reviews
your opinion of them forms quickly. Likewise, consistently great code can help
you stand apart.

This was the reality for Chris while working with the remote team. Being a talk
on code reviews he found some special ones to highlight the lessons he wanted to
share. After a while the code reviews became the main representation
of peoples' current ability.

Topic:

Order?

* Idea of your code review reflecting you as Chris presented it
* Your feelings of investment in your code
* You are not your code. Detach feelings
* Care and be professional

Invested
===============================================================================

It is really easy to become invested in your code. I often find I put lots of
effort and care into my work I do. You become emotionally invested. Too often
I am extremely defencive about my code and take too feedback personally.

The feelings of ownership intensify the longer I have been with a project and
what role I had in its formation. This is where I am with my current project.
We have been on it since it began and seen it go through many changes.

Last week I was able to wrap up a project I had slowly been working on for 7
months. I presented about this project and how the code changed over time.
Due to this work I feel personally responsible for the code. Any feedback on
the project or results reflect on me.

This year I am experimenting with lots [thin slicing][slicing] all my work. The
result has been many many more code reviews. This has created new challenges for
code reviews since the overall picture can be harder to see.

TODO: make the connection stronger

Connecting this with what Chris said, I take feedback to my code reviews to
heart. On the receiving end I really care about maintaining the quality of
what we built. When I send code reviews I try to be careful in how I approach
the changes I make. The darkside is when the comments I give or receive
are treated like an attack.

You Are Not Your Code
===============================================================================

There are many great [blog][scott] [posts][jeff] about how [you are not your code][google]. I
need to take this message to heart and separate myself from suggestions and
improvements to code I have created. Assume the best intentions an use each
review as a learning opportunity.

How does this work if the way your colleagues think about you is with respect
to the code reviews you send them? If you are not your code, then what are your
code reviews? In reflecting on the talk, I think code reviews are the primary
way your co-workers think about how you program.

Feedback from others is a great opportunity to learn. A suggestion on a code
review could help you learn a new way to approach a familiar problem.

Caring Professionally
===============================================================================

In talking with Chris he cares about the humans behind their code reviews. In
teasing apart what he said and reflecting on it I think caring is the most
important part. Not getting emotionally attached to your code, but putting
your best foot forward and caring about your work.

If someone else if going to take the time to review your code be kind to them.
One of the recommendations from the talk was to make sure the best review of
your code was the review you do prior to sending it to someone else. Go through
your changes on your own and clean up any loose ends. Comments explaining
decisions you made or other hints help others understand your thought process.

I think constantly improving and trying you best is part of being a professional
programmer. Learning from your code reviews and putting effort into each of them
is important. Try to make the the most of each review and the feedback you
receive.

[Jeff Atwood][jeff] gives this recommendation

Be someone who cares about your work. Do your best.
