I recently attended a bunch of fantastic developer talks where I [work][d2l].
My co-worker, Chris, had a very interesting talk about lessons he learnt during
7 months of code reviews with a team from another office. He had some great
insights I have been thinking through. The one which sticks with me is: how your
code reviews are a reflection of you.

Chris had the benefit of helping a remote team get started. It was really hard
and I appreciate the work his team put in. His presentation reviewed what he
learned after months of working with the same people. Code reviews were the
focal point for most of his interactions.

In his talk, Chris took an extreme position. For some people their code reviews
is the primary way you interact with them. You don't know them as a person and
you cannot see them on a daily basis. If they keep giving crappy code reviews
your opinion of them forms quickly. Likewise, consistently great code can help
you stand apart.

This was the reality for Chris while working with the remote team. Being a talk
on code reviews he found some special ones to highlight the lessons he wanted to
share. After a while the code reviews became the main representation
of peoples' current ability.

Invested
===============================================================================

It is really easy to become invested in your code. I often find I put lots of
effort and care into my work I do. You become emotionally invested. Too often
I am extremely defencive about my code and take too feedback personally.

The feelings of ownership intensify the longer I have been with a project and
what role I had in its formation. This is where I am with my current project.
We have been on it since it began and seen it go through many changes.

Over the last few weeks I was able to wrap up a project I had slowly been working on for 7
months. I presented about this project and how the code changed over time.
Due to this work I feel personally responsible for the code. Any feedback on
the project or results reflect on me.

This year I am experimenting with lots [thin slicing][slicing] all my work. The
result has been many many more code reviews. This has created new challenges for
code reviews since the overall picture can be harder to see. More code reviews
mean more times I need to put myself on the line.

Connecting this with what Chris said, I take feedback to my code reviews to
heart. On the receiving end ,I really care about maintaining the quality of
what we built. When I send code reviews I try to be careful in how I approach
making changes and hope I don't look stupid.

The darkside is when I treat the comments I give or receive like an attack.
Reviews need to be an open discussion and not a moment to show how smart you are.
Instead, humility and listening need to be an important part of each code review.

I am self conscious about by ability as a developer. I often feel like an
[imposter][imposter]. Combined putting myself out there in my code reviews
you get a potent mix of feelings and lack of confidence. My inner phony is
on display.

You Are Not Your Code
===============================================================================

There are many great [blog][scott] [posts][jeff] about how [you are not your code][google]. I
need to take this message to heart and separate myself from suggestions and
improvements to code I have created.

How does this work if the way your colleagues think about you is with respect
to your code reviews? This seems like the opposite perspective from
'you are not your code'.

This contradiction was what gave me pause.

Caring Professionally
===============================================================================

I think both ideas can fit together. The sum total of your being is not
the code you write. How you present yourself, learn, care and interact with
others is a clear reflection of what you value.

In talking with Chris, he cares about the humans behind their code reviews. In
teasing apart what he said and reflecting on it I think caring is the most
important part of each review. Not getting emotionally attached to your code,
but putting your best foot forward and caring about your work.

If someone else if going to take the time to review your code be kind to them.
One of the recommendations from the talk was to make sure the best review of
your code was the review you do prior to sending it to someone else. Go through
your changes on your own and clean up any loose ends. Add comments explaining
the decisions you made.

I think constantly improving and trying you best is part of being a professional
programmer. Learning from your code reviews and putting effort into each of them
is important. Try to make the the most of each review and the feedback you
receive.

Be supportive when interactive with others. Don't stomp around and shoot down
their ideas. Treat others how you want to be treated and you cannot go wrong.

Although I don't count myself as a great developer, like [Jeff Atwood][jeff]
I care too much.

The solution is to convert my caring into actions which help the team. Care
about your work and do your best.
