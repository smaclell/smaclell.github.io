I recently attended a bunch of fantastic developer talks where I [work][d2l].
My co-worker, Chris, had a very interesting talk about lessons he learnt during
7 months of code reviews with a team from another office  He had some great
insights and one which I have been thinking through is how the code you share
in your code reviews is a reflection of you.

Topic:

Order?

* Idea of your code review reflecting you as Chris presented it
* Your feelings of investment in your code
* You are not your code. Detach feelings
* Care and be professional

It is really easy to become invested in your code. I often find I put lots of
effort and care into my work I do. You become emotionally invested. Too often
I am extremely defencive about my code and take too feedback personally.

There are many great [blog][scott] [posts][horror] about how [you are not your code][google]. I
need to take this message to heart and separate myself from suggestions and
improvements to code I help support.


*Reminder: My blog is my own opinion and not necessarily that of my employer.
That said thanks for the great sessions!*
