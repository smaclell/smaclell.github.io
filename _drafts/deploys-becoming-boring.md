Notes to self:

* Do no patronize
* There is only us
* Be humble
* No complaints
* Believe in the best intent
* Avoid editorializing the reactions of others

In The Beginning
=======================================

Cite CD book regarding

* Ceremony
* Fear
* Pressure to make the date

__Trouble Promoting__

* Defects
* Lack of Trust
* Deadlocking - want stability and hurting from defects
* Forked code
* Different goals

Bogdan's comment of Rocket Ship and a Steam Engine

The Agreement
=======================================

* regular weekly deployments
* known changes
* validated

The Iterations
=======================================

At first not smooth but became stable within a few iterations.
Found a few defects with the process that were fixed right away.
Initially there was alot of pressure to CRAM more in but now happily wait
until the next week.
Now it is down to one click per service.
We started building things smaller and our quality went up.
Included more validation in the process.

Routine Again
=======================================

Each success built more trust.
Any member of the team can perform the deployment and is downright boring.
Stakeholders who wanted to slow previously now want fixes and features early.

Next
=======================================

Even faster, full continous deployment. Twice as fast to other environments.

Can I include a diagram of our pipeline?
