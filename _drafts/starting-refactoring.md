I think refactoring is an essential developer skill. Writing new code is fun
and can help you do awesome things. However, if you only write new code and
leave your existing code to languish your users may not be happy for long.
Maintaining code and keeping it clean will help you to stay productive. In my
effort to [focus][focus], I have been trying to double down on improving core
developers skills. This post will highlight what I have been learning and
provide a starting point for you to go further.
