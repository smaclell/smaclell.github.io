You are in a dark room. Completely alone. Surrounding you is pitch black so
thick you can feel it. Sounds in the distance are terrifying, echoing off
the walls. Welcome to Server Core, the land of eternal darkness.

My first experience with Windows Server Core was this frightening. I logged in
an saw only a prompt. Hoping to find more I closed the prompt and was left with
nothing. No prompt, no other windows, just a blank background. I didn't know
what to do and was afraid.

Despite getting completely lost the first time I used Server Core, I still
think it is awesome. Using fewer resources per server is fantastic. The
complete control over exactly what you want to put on the machine is even
better.

It did not take long before I found the light. Using the commandline is
liberating and can help you get more done with less effort. In this post I will
show you the commands I needed to use and just enough to get around. I spent
about a week trying to create a lean Server Core template for our .NET
application. Throughout the week I found lots of helpful links and a few
essential commands.
 I was completely lost without any prompt.
