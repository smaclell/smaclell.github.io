Unfiltered AAA.

You want the tests to be the forefront of what you are showing.

You should be able to see all three parts clearly in the tests. Pull redundancy into the methods, but try to keep as much as you can in the tests.

Keep what you are testing in the tests themself and not in helper methods.
Keep it as simple as possible
Do not duplicate the code.
Duplicate tests? Do cases make sense? Risk => inputs/outputs start to be harder to follow.
Choose what you want to do with mocks (I started with mocking then moved to reusable fakes.)
