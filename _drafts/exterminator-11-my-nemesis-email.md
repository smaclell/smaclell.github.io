This week I was confounded by my nemesis, email. Too often email and
notifications knock me out of the zone and drain my focus. I have been doubling
down to finish everything for our upcoming release and find myself constantly
distracted by checking email for anything to help us wrap up.

The rise of immersive technology has made escaping the digital world a
requirement for being able to get things done. As a part of my yearly
goal for [improving my focus][focus] and get things done I
have been trying to eliminate my digital noise. Removing as many
interruptions or alerts as possible.

I started with trying to reduce the number of times I am distracted by
email and am finding it particularly hard. We use email as a part of team
activities, like [code reviews][reviews], where any delays I have in
responding will further delay the work being done.

Further Reading
===============================================================================

There are plenty of recommendations for how to deal email and improve your
focus.

According to Scott Hanselman [complete list of productivity tips][tips]
is a recommendation to not check email in the morning (or at night). Borrowed
from David Allen, he suggests you should schedule time to check your email
and otherwise work on more important things.

David Allen as a part of his best selling book [Getting things Done][done]
advocates for a 2 minute rule. While doing a routine task which will result in
new work to be done, deal with anything you can finish in 2 minutes
*immediately*! This will help clear out small things so you can get back to the
more important tasks.

Application
===============================================================================

Inspired by these recommendations, I have been trying to turn off email except
for a few minutes after lunch. Outlook can remain closed while I get work one.
For the most part this works out great; most email is not urgent and can wait.
It has been weeks of getting my inbox completely empty. The 2 minute rule is
golden.

**Schedule when to check email, otherwise turn it off.** With email out of
sight I check it less often and can focus more on my work. I am not there yet,
but I would like to only check my email once a day. Closing my email for most
of the day has been fantastic.

**Use the 2 minute rule to quickly dispatch most email.** If you ready [GTD][done]
and get nothing other than the 2 minute rule, it is worth it! I have been able to
clear out many emails and keep going thanks to this simple rule.

**Fewer meetings.** There are many meetings you could go to, but very few you
should go to. I have been trying to remove as many meetings as possible. This
has been a tradeoff and you may find you are missing out. So far it has freed
up my calendar and helped me to remain focused. As a bonus, not going to
meetings frees you up from any planning and follow up activities. If a meeting
really needs you, they will let you know.

**Prune the distributions lists you are on.**

**Turn off email alerts/pop ups.** If your email is open, you don't want to be
distracted by notifications. Turn them off and love life.

**Get urgent communication differently.** Urgent and important requests, like
code reviews, come in all the time via email. I have been trying to work with
others on my team to use a team chat or other way to get this information
faster.

As a developer I want to spend as much time as I can heads down. I have been
trying to cut out meeting and remove other distractions. My scheduled time
to check email has helped me isolate this activity so I can spend more time
programming.

I have disabled the alerts I get every time there is a new message. I evalauted

Where I continue to struggle is with important and urgent emails/notifications.
I need to give Brian feedback on his pull requests as quickly as possible so
we can finish merge his changes and do more testing. If I miss his pull request
for hours this can cause work to get backed up and slow down the project. I
have moved some of these requests to chat notifications, but feel this is an
area I could improve more.

Where i am still struggling. Being part of a team. If i am on the zone i am not helping others.
Code reviews where i need to work with others, where delays do not add value.
This means letting myself be interrupted more or making sure i take breaks to unblock others. Finding the middle ground is tough.

Encouragement
===============================================================================

I have found it very useful to be mindful of what is throwing me off. For me
email is a big stumbling block.

What is your biggest distraction? What could you do to get rid of it?
