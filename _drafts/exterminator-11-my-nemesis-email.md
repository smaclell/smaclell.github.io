This week I was confounded by my nemesis, email. Too often email and
notifications knock me out of the zone and drain my focus. I have been doubling
down to finish everything for our upcoming release and find myself constantly
distracted by checking email for anything to help us wrap up.

The rise of immersive technology has made escaping the digital world a
requirement for being able to get things done. As a part of my yearly
goal for [improving my focus][focus] and get things done I
have been trying to eliminate my digital noise. Removing as many
interruptions or alerts as possible.

I started with trying to reduce the number of times I am distracted by
email and am finding it particularly hard. We use email as a part of team
activities, like [code reviews][reviews], where any delays I have in
responding will further delay the work being done.

Further Reading
===============================================================================

There are plenty of recommendations for how to deal email and improve your
focus.

According to Scott Hanselman [complete list of productivity tips][tips]
is a recommendation to not check email in the morning (or at night). Borrowed
from David Allen, he suggests you should schedule time to check your email
and otherwise work on more important things.

David Allen as a part of his best selling book [Getting things Done][done]
advocates for a 2 minute rule. While doing a routine task which will result in
new work to be done, deal with anything you can finish in 2 minutes
*immediately*! This will help clear out small things so you can get back to the
more important tasks.

What I am Trying
===============================================================================

Inspired by these recommendations, I have been trying to find ways to reduce my
email addiction and focus on getting my work done. For the past few weeks I
am trying to deal with my email differently. The early results are positive
and so I thought I would share what I have done here.

**Check email less by closing my email client.** Rather than leaving my email
client open all the time, I have been trying to keep it closed most days. This
has not been easy and I often find myself going to check email when I don't
want to be.

**Use the 2 minute rule to quickly dispatch most email.** If you ready [GTD][done]
and get nothing other than the 2 minute rule, it is worth it! I have been able to
clear out many emails and keep going thanks to this simple rule.

**Prune the distributions lists you are on.** While on loan to
[Exterminators][tribute] I stopped subscribing to several email lists and
rerouted others groups to folders I could check less frequently. Less email
means I can spend less time dealing with email. This has also resulted in
fewer meetings and other distractions.

**Turn off email alerts.** If your email is open, you don't want to be
distracted by notifications. Turn them off and love your life.

**Stop using email for urgent activities.** Urgent and important requests, like
code reviews, all come via email. We have started using instant messaging for
requests like this which allows us to receive these important notifications
faster.

Next Steps
===============================================================================

Cutting down on my email interruptions has been going well, but I think there
is still more I could do.

I have dabbled with not checking email in the morning with little success.
Working with different timezones has meant responding to messages early helps
unblock the other teams. As an alternative, I am trying to start checking my
email once a day during a scheduled window. Checking email only once takes
discipline and I think with enough effort I can get there. So far I am have
been able to do it a few days a week and hope I can get into the habit.

After adjusting the email lists I am a part of I have started thinking about
other things I can cut out. Did I need to be on those lists in the first place?
How did I start participating in them? What am I missing by not subscribing?
What else should I stop doing?



This has been great so far and I am sure I can do better.

turn off email except
for a few minutes after lunch. Outlook can remain closed while I get work one.
For the most part this works out great; most email is not urgent and can wait.
It has been weeks of getting my inbox completely empty. The 2 minute rule is
golden.

 The next step for checking email less is only checking email once a
day during a short scheduled window. When I have been able to check email only
once a day I feel like I am able to stay focused and get more done.

Adjusting these lists has helped me understand the normal messages I receive,
but do not need to act on.

**Fewer meetings.** There are many meetings you could go to, but very few you
should go to. I have been trying to remove as many meetings as possible. This
has been a tradeoff and you may find you are missing out. So far it has freed
up my calendar and helped me to remain focused. As a bonus, not going to
meetings frees you up from any planning and follow up activities. If a meeting
really needs you, they will let you know.

As a developer I want to spend as much time as I can heads down. I have been
trying to cut out meeting and remove other distractions. My scheduled time
to check email has helped me isolate this activity so I can spend more time
programming.

I have disabled the alerts I get every time there is a new message. I evalauted

Where I continue to struggle is with important and urgent emails/notifications.
I need to give Brian feedback on his pull requests as quickly as possible so
we can finish merge his changes and do more testing. If I miss his pull request
for hours this can cause work to get backed up and slow down the project. I
have moved some of these requests to chat notifications, but feel this is an
area I could improve more.

Where i am still struggling. Being part of a team. If i am on the zone i am not helping others.
Code reviews where i need to work with others, where delays do not add value.
This means letting myself be interrupted more or making sure i take breaks to unblock others. Finding the middle ground is tough.

Encouragement
===============================================================================

I have found it very useful to be mindful of what is throwing me off. For me
email is a big stumbling block.

What is your biggest distraction? What could you do to get rid of it?
