This week I am presenting to a large number of coworkers about work I started
as an [Exterminator](#). For those which want to learn more about that time I
wanted to summarize all of the posts I had done.

Earlier this year I went on a 4-month rotation to a different team. It a great
opportunity I learnt a great deal from doing. While on rotation I tried to
regularly blog what I was doing and what I was learning from it. Here is a
summary of all those posts.

*[I volunteer as tribute](/posts/i-volunteer-as-tribute/)*. This was my first
post. I was really excited to join the Exterminator team. Learning new
things and helping people.

*[The 4 Stages of Legacy Code](/posts/exterminators-1-the-4-stages-of-legacy-code/)*.
I had dived straight in and was having fun digging into code without tests.
I was accustomed to thorough test suites and working on brand new code. In the
end I was able to get through it and find good ways to approach this new
challenge.

*[Focus and Quality](/posts/exterminators-2-focus-and-quality/)*. In order to keep myself honest, I
blogged about my goals for the year and how I intended to approach them.
This post and my goals, focus and quality, were a great way to ensure I was
concentrating on the right things while I was an Exterminator. The links included with
this post are fantastic and with the year end approaching it is time for me
to read them again.

*[On Comments](/posts/exterminator-3-on-comments/)*. We talked about what makes
for good comments in code. Which comments are not necessary or too verbose. I
highlight a few cases where I think comments really add to the code. There is also some
amazing C code with silly comments.

*[DAMP Unfiltered AAA](/posts/exterminator-4-damp-unfiltered-aaa-tests/)*. With
my added focus on quality, I spent lots of time writing tests. I delve into how
trying to not repeat yourself and stay DRY makes tests much harder to
understand. Instead, you want descriptive and meaningful phrases (DAMP) so
yours tests are clear.

*[Pull Requests](/posts/exterminator-5-pull-request-explosion/)*. I tried
dabbling with breaking up a larger chunk of work into small pull requests.
This led to a pull request explosion! Everything became a small pull request
layered upon other pull requests. This fun exercise set the tone for the rest of
my time as an Exterminator.

*[Code Reviews](/posts/exterminator-6-code-reviews/)*. I share my approach to
code reviews. I strive to learn/share ideas and understand the underlying logic
being updated. Hopefully, this approach leads to better conversations about the
code change.

*[Discuss into Action](/posts/exterminators-7-action-retros/)*. We had a
retrospective which did not sit well with me. It was a good conversation but
did not lead to any action items. I was left wanting more.

*[The Wrong Time to Refactor](/posts/exterminator-9-wrong-time-to-refactor/)*.
I like refactoring A LOT. You might even say too much. We were the day before
a release and fixing a late bug. I wanted to refactor the code more. We
decided as a team this was not the right thing to do. Later, we were able to
safely complete the refactoring.

*[Caught By Conventions](/posts/exterminator-10-caught-by-conventions/)*. Oops.
I learnt a lesson by swimming upstream. I was excited to try a new tool,
[Specflow][specflow], and started by contributing code to another project. I
missed the memo and broke all the conventions within their project. It was very
frustrating and then I realized I had done this to myself. I was able to learn
from my bad pull request and teach others the lessons I encountered.

*[My Nemesis, Email](/posts/exterminator-11-my-nemesis-email/)*. I was
very distracted this week. I go over some techniques for reducing your
interruptions, particularly from email.

*[Finding the Bottleneck](/posts/exterminator-12-finding-the-bottleneck/)*.
This is a basic introduction to some of the performance testing tools in
Visual Studio. We were able to find hot spots in our code and apply
improvements. I then break down the process, highlight some of our biases
and lessons for next time. Go deeper.

I hope enjoyed these posts from my time as an Exterminator.
