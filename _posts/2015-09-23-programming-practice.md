Lately I have been having fun doing programming problems online. They are a
nice way to go over exercises and practice various techniques.

I think it is important to program for fun. Put away your normal work and go
hack on something. There is no pressure or deadlines. Programming because
you want to.

My coworker wanted some feedback on some problems he had been doing.
The site he used was [exercism.io][exercism]. It has a number of problems in
different languages for various levels of difficulty. All the problems include
a short description and unit tests which your solution should pass. You can see
and comment on solutions by other people. The one catch is you must have first
solved the problem yourself. I have been getting into some of the problems
lately at the cost of my regular blog posts :(.

For a while I was competing with some friends to see who could get further on
[Project Euler][euler]. The site is filled with various math problems which are
best solved using programming. Sure you might be able to calculate a few by
hand, but the real fun is writing code to find the solution. Some problems can
be brute forced whereas others need a more intelligent solution.

I also enjoy reviewing various algorithms and techniques though the
regular updates from [Coding for Interviews][interviews]. They
review some fundamental data structure or algorithm and provide sample problems.
Less raw programming fun and more solid practice.

There you have it. A few handy fun sites to find new challenges:

* [exercism.io][exercism]
* [Project Euler][euler]
* [Coding for Interviews][interviews]

Go code!

**Bonus:**

Coding for Interviews has a list of other [practice][practice] sites and why they
like them. I have not seen most of the sites before and think they could be
fun! On their is list [codewars][codewars] which offers community curated
problems and a ranking system. My brother in-law raves about them and really
enjoys their problems.
