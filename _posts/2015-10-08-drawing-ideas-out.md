Listening is important. If you spend all your time talking you will miss good
ideas. We have been working closely with another team who is coming up to
speed. Instead of helping direct the project I need to shift my efforts to
drawing out their good ideas and supporting them.

We had been lined up to work with another team on a project. Due to logistics it was
decided the project would be easier if they lead the development.
We would assist them and discuss different ideas, but not much else.

No Monopoly on Good Ideas
===============================================================================

Prior to the project starting we had spent a great deal of time thinking about
the overall problem and potential solutions. The affected code would integrate
heavily into what we have done. Over time we have become subject matter experts
which has led to strong opinions about how things should be done.

Like many developers I want to solve problems. You know build cool stuff! This
normally involves rolling up my sleeves and diving in. I like choosing how to
approach different problems and then working with our team to get it done.

However, to succeed on this project I need to put aside my own ideas and
listen. Instead of starting with my own opinion, I need to facilitate the
conversation so their ideas shine through. My co-worker Daryl put it
fantastically, *"they have good ideas, we need to help draw them out"*.

Arguing for my own ideas would be counterproductive. The goal is not to show
off how smart we are or build up my ego. We could hand them over the master
plan we would have followed and miss the mark completely. It would
kill the project and crush any autonomy the other team has.

The point is to make the project a success and help our clients. Together, we
need to focus on shipping great software to meet the client needs.

The Great Ideas Are Waiting
===============================================================================

The other team has great developers who are going to do a fantastic job. While
we might have a head start in knowing the problem domain, they will be able to
come up to speed. We did. We need to give them the space to solve their own
problems and to ask questions which will help them come to their own
solutions.

Lately they have been wrestling through various challenges. It has been fun
discussing potential options with them. Every conversation goes a little
deeper. They have been learning a lot and are doing well.

Their solution looks different than how I pictured it in my mind and I think
that is fantastic! It shows they are finding their own path.

The great ideas are waiting. Together we can draw them out.

*Thanks FTO for being patient with us and the continuing discussions. I cannot
wait until V1 ships. Thanks Daryl for being awesome and letting me learn from
you. Thank you Travis for gently reminding me I don't
have a monopoly on good ideas and coming up with the phrase.*
