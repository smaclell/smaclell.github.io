My [Exterminator rotation][tribute] is now over and it is time to return to my
original team. To help reset after the transition I took a short vacation,
travelled a few thousand kilometers, saw Niagara Falls and went camping.
I am now relaxed and ready to get back to work.

<!-- The total approximate distance of the trip was over 4000 km -->

One of the things I am looking forward to is the focus and isolation of being
in the zone. Completely blocking out the world and getting things done.

While thinking about trying to cut down on my [email time][email],
it made me realize I follow the same sequence every day to
get into the zone:

0. Put in my earbuds
1. Open programs I need
2. Close everything I don't need
3. [Turn][songza-park] [up][songza-neo] [the][songza-aggressive] [music][songza-hero] [and][songza-film] [drop the bass][dubstep].
4. Enter the zone

Tomorrow I am looking forward to getting into the zone, diving in and coding
something awesome. I hope you have a great day and get into the zone.
