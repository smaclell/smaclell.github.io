This week I was confounded by my nemesis, email. Too often email and
notifications knock me out of the zone and drain my focus. I have been doubling
down to finish everything for our upcoming release and find myself constantly
distracted by checking email for anything to help us wrap up.

The rise of immersive technology has made escaping the digital world a
requirement for being able to get things done. As a part of my yearly
goal for [improving my focus][focus], I
have been trying to eliminate my digital noise by removing as many
interruptions/alerts as possible.

I started with trying to reduce the number of times I am distracted by
email and am finding it particularly hard. We use email as a part of team
activities, like [code reviews][reviews], where any delays responding to them
cause further delays to the work being done.

Further Reading
===============================================================================

There are plenty of recommendations for how to deal email and improve your
focus. Here are two I particularly liked.

In Scott Hanselman [complete list of productivity tips][tips],
he recommendations not checking email in the morning (or at night). Borrowed
from David Allen, he suggests you should schedule time to check your email
and otherwise work on more important things.

David Allen, in his best selling book [Getting things Done][done],
advocates for a 2-minute rule. While reviewing incoming work/requests the 2-minute rule
suggests you should deal with anything you can finish in less than 2-minutes
*immediately*! This will help finish small distractions so you can get back to the
more important tasks.

What I am Trying
===============================================================================

Inspired by these recommendations, I have been experimenting with ways to reduce my
email addiction and focus on getting my work done.
The early results are positive and so I thought I would share what I am trying with you.

**Check email less by closing your email client.** Rather than leaving my email
client open all the time, I have been trying to keep it closed most days. This
has not been easy and I often find myself going to check email when I don't
want to be. This is a compromise from only check my email once a day so I can
better deal with more urgent requests, like code reviews.

**Use the 2-minute rule to quickly dispatch most email.** If you read [GTD][done]
and get nothing other than the 2-minute rule, it is worth it! I have been able to
clear out many small messages and keep going thanks to this simple rule.

**Prune the distributions lists you are on.** While on loan to
[Exterminators][tribute] I stopped subscribing to several email lists and
rerouted others notifications to folders I could check less frequently. Less email
means I can spend less time dealing with email. This has also resulted in
fewer meetings and other distractions.

**Turn off email alerts.** If your email is open, you don't want to be
distracted by notifications. Turn them off and love your life.

**Stop using email for urgent activities.** Many of my urgent and important requests, like
code reviews, arrive via email. We have started using instant messaging as a team. Some
urgent requests have started to move to instance messaging which allows us to deal with
important notifications faster.

Next Steps
===============================================================================

Cutting down on my email interruptions has been going well, but I think there
is still more I could do.

I have dabbled with not checking email in the morning with little success.
Working with teams in different time zones has meant if I do not read my
email and respond in the morning we start blocking each other.

As an alternative, I am trying to only check my
email once or twice a day during scheduled windows. This will take
discipline and I think I can make it part of my routine with enough effort.
So far I have
been able to do it a few days a week and hope I can make it a habit.

After adjusting the email lists I am a part of I have started thinking about
other things I can cut out. Why was I on those lists in the first place?
What am I missing by not subscribing? What else should I stop doing? Based on
these questions I have started reconsidering the meetings I attend and projects
to pursue or defer.

Encouragement
===============================================================================

I have found it very useful to be mindful of what is throwing me off. For me
email is a big stumbling block. Defeating this distraction has been great and
helped me stay in the zone longer.

What is your biggest distraction? What could you do to get rid of it?
